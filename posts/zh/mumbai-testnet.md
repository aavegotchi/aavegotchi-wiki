Once you’ve added everything, you can click on “Save”. You are now on Mumbai Testnet!

## Getting tokens from Mumbai Faucet

1). Head over to the Mumbai Faucet at [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

2). Select the tokens that you wish to get from the faucet (e.g. MATIC token), select the default Network (Mumbai), and input your Metamask wallet address into the textbox.

3). Hit the "Submit" button and wait for the tokens to be deposited into your wallet.

## Getting Mumbai GHST

Once you have gotten your hands on some MATIC tokens from the Mumbai Faucet, it is time to purchase some Mumbai GHST.

1). Head over to [https://testnet.aavegotchi.com/testnet-ghst](https://testnet.aavegotchi.com/testnet-ghst).

2). Connect to the Mumbai Testnet.

3). Use the Mumbai MATIC tokens you have received to purchase Mumbai GHST by clicking the "Click to get MUMBAI GHST" button. Presto! You are done!
