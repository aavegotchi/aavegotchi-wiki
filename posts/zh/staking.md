## Staking & Frens

To stake GHST you must first get GHST.  The easiest way to get GHST is to purchase it from the [ETH/GHST Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH). It can also be purchased from the [GHST bonding curve](https://aavegotchi.com/curve).

Once you have GHST you can stake it directly in the staking contract or you can put it into the [ETH/GHST Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550/ETH) and get pool tokens back that you stake into the staking contract.

The amount of ETH and GHST required to acquire 1ETH/GHST LP token varies based on the price of the pool token at the time.

You earn 1 frens point per day for each GHST token staked. You earn 100 frens points per day for each GHST/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool token staked.

*1 GHST earns 1 FRENS point per day, and 1 GHST-ETH LP token earns 100 FRENS / day*

Go to the [staking user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-mainnet) to stake GHST and/or GHST/ETH pool tokens.  This webpage will also show you how many frens points you have accumulated.

Frens points are not transferable. They accumulate for your Ethereum address and you can't transfer them to a different address. You can use them to purchase raffle tickets.

## Purchasing Raffle Tickets

Once you have enough frens go to the [Shop Bulk Buy user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/bulk-buy) to purchase raffle tickets with frens.

There are six different levels of raffle tickets:

Winning prizes depends on which tickets and how many tickets you enter into a raffle, how many prizes there are, and how many tickets other people submit.
