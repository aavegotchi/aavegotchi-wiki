Heya Fren! Did you know that if *certain wearables* are equipped together, you can get a set bonus above and beyond their individual wearables? Now you do!

**Wearable Sets** are collections of wearables that confer an additional bonus on the Aavegotchi equipping them.

Get ready a fat stack of GHST! You will need them!

The colour of the border surrounding the wearables indicates its rarity:
* <p style="color:#806AFB">Common: Cornflower Blue</p>
* <p style="color:#98DBE5">Uncommon: Water Leaf</p>
* <p style="color:#59BCFF">Rare: Malibu</p>
* <p style="color:#FFC36B">Legendary: Koromiko</p>
* <p style="color:#FF96FF">Mythical: Lavender Rose</p>
* <p style="color:#51FFA8">Godlike: Aquamarine</p>
