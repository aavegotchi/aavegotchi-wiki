### Supply ~3.5M Treasury DAI to Aave
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #105**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal suggests allocating 3,549,809 DAI from the Aavegotchi DAO Treasury to the Aave V3 Ethereum Market. With an average supply APR of 4.34%, this move aims to generate an annual yield of approximately $154,061, enhancing the DAO's revenue through a stable, high-yield strategy. The proposal ensures over 500,000 DAI remains in the DAO's Polygon wallet for ongoing initiatives, while the rest of the DAI is strategically supplied to Aave. All supplied DAI comes from the 25% post curve closure Treasury Allocation.

*Proposed Porfolio Composition Assuming AGIP 103 Passes*

Proposed Portfolio USD Value

* GHST (0.904) 15017760.91

* USDC 3756276

* Supplied DAI 3549809

* Unsupplied DAI 2337064

* ETH (not yet purchased) 3000000

*Benefits:*

1. Passive Income: Leverages a stable, high-yield avenue for revenue generation without active management.

2. Flexibility: Easy entry and exit strategies for the supplied positions, offering liquidity management benefits.

3. Market Optimism: Positions the DAO to capitalize on the anticipated increased demand for stablecoins in an upcoming bull market.

4. Diversification: Broadens the DAO's investment portfolio and protects our stablecoins against inflation by generating yield.

*Risks:*

1. Platform Dependence: Relies heavily on the Aave ecosystem and the stability of its smart contracts, introducing platform-specific risks.

2. Liquidity Constraints: Future proposals may require accessing funds from the supplied DAI if the Polygon treasury depletes, potentially affecting liquidity.

3. Market Volatility: Exposure to market fluctuations could affect the APR and overall returns.

4. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Despite Aave's track record, the risk of smart contract bugs or exploits remains inherent in DeFi protocols.

The proposal represents a balanced approach to revenue generation and risk management, aiming to strengthen the Aavegotchi DAO's financial position while maintaining operational flexibility.

### Gotchi Battler - Prize Pool Funding
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #107**

**Proposal Summary:**

*IMPORTANT CHANGES FROM SIGPROP*

Following lengthy discussions in the DAO, please note the following changes from the sigprop:

* For Rarity Farming Season 8, Gotchi Battler will receive a 10% allocation of rewards, coming from the BRS leaderboard.

* For Rarity Farming Season 9 and onwards, Gotchi Battler will receive a 20% allocation of rewards, coming from the BRS leaderboard, unless a Coreprop is passed that changes this allocation up or down.

Immaterial has also formally agreed to open-source the Gotchi Battler game logic after Season 8 completes so every battle can be verified after the fact but no advantages can be gained for Season 8 through building simulations. Then, from Season 9 onwards, more complexity/variations will be added so that simulations will be too computationally expensive to be worth it.

Hello frens,

We've been blown away and deeply humbled by all the enthusiasm and support for Gotchi Battler over the last few weeks. We're starting this proposal to deliver on the promise of evolving protocol rewards through the addition of Gotchi Battler as a staple of our Rarity Farming seasons going forward.

The proposed changes to Rarity Farming Rewards are:

Season 8

table_gotchiBattlerSeason8

Season 9 onwards

table_gotchiBattlerSeason9

In line with the original Gotchi Battler proposal [AGIP 86](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals-2023#gotchi-battler-funding) to gamify protocol rewards, we wish to reallocate 10% from the BRS leaderboard to Gotchi Battler Tournaments for season 8 and 20% from the BRS leaderboard for Season 9 and onwards. Gotchi Battler was designed with this exact purpose in mind to carry on the meta of the BRS leaderboard as much as possible whilst also providing a more engaging and competitive experience for players.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1201505887169286276)

Option 1: Yes, reallocate rewards to GB

Option 2: Do, don't include Gotchi Battler

### Lend 600k GHST to improve liquidity and orderbooks on major CEXs
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #110**

**Proposal Summary:**

*New:*

Please note the new specific KPIs and repayment strike prices documented in part 1 of the “Solution” section.

*BACKGROUND*

When the GHST Bonding Curve closed in early 2023, our governance token lost its deepest liquidity pool (paired with DAI). To prepare for the coming loss of this GHST/DAI pool, Pixelcraft Studios took it upon themselves to lend a total of 300k GHST to Skynet Trading, a liquidity solutions company, to bolster liquidity on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.

Skynet Trading has successfully fulfilled its role as a market maker for GHST throughout 2023, consistently maintaining the most liquidity for GHST on Coinbase.

The loans that made this possible will soon expire but Skynet Trading is open to continuing to support GHST initiatives. I believe any future collaboration is something better suited to be executed by AavegotchiDAO.

*Proposal*

With the first year viewed as a sort of due diligence, I am now proposing that AavegotchiDAO replace Pixelcraft Studios with new loans to Skynet Trading, beginning with 600k GHST for 12 months explicitly to improve GHST’s liquidity on more centralized exchanges.

Skynet Trading is dedicated to providing trading services that aim to reduce slippage by narrowing spreads, increase the accessibility of GHST by focusing on spread and depth key performance indicators, encourage organic trading through the development of attractive order books, and minimize the impact of large market orders. Whereas last year’s focus was primarily on Coinbase, a 600k-sized loan makes it possible for Skynet Trading to also provide liquidity on Binance, OKX, and HTX respectively.

*The Problem: Poor liquidity on CEXs.*

The screenshot from coinmarketcap (Feb 9, 2024) illustrates the poor liquidity of GHST on exchanges. Most GHST pairs suffer from significantly thin books. This means GHST is inaccessible to people seeking medium to large allocations on most exchanges. Working with Skynet to improve liquidity across exchanges is a strategic move to foster a better trading environment for all participants interested in GHST tokens.

*Solution:*

*PART I: Loan Terms and Goals*

This proposal is for AavegotchiDAO to lend 600k GHST to Skynet Trading for a 12 month term. The loaned GHST shall be used as liquidity provisions across four exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Huobi.

Skynet Trading’s terms impose no retainer fee, no setup fee, or trading fees.

Newly Published KPIs and Strike Price Formula:

Tight spreads: No greater than 50 bps.

Deep order books: Minimum of 25 orders on both sides of the book. 10k USDT across

Repayment strike price:

-300k tokens @TWAP7 from start

-150k tokens @TWAP7 from 3 months into the agreement

-150k tokens @TWAP7 from 6 months into the agreement

* The exact strike price formula was not included in the Sigprop but are now revealed per requests from DAO members and Skynet obliged. I can confirm the team has agreed to add the 3 and 6 month out terms in light of our concerns about frontloading all strike prices near the beginning of this potentially bullish year. At the end of the 12 month term, Skynet Trading will have the option to A) return the 600k GHST to AavegotchiDAO or B) purchase the GHST at the strike prices as defined in this proposal.

*PART II: Responsibilities*

The second part of this proposal defines the relationship between AavegotchiDAO and Skynet Trading and who executes which responsibilities. The solution offered is the creation of a Liquidity Management Task Force (LMTF).

The Signer shall be a current director from Aavegotchi DAO Foundation willing to sign the contract between Skynet Lending and the Aavegotchi DAO Foundation. The Signer must be willing to KYC by providing liveness check and passport scans.

The Primary Point of Contact (PPC) shall be the leadership team at Pixelcraft Studios. They shall continue to maintain daily contact between the two main parties and always advocate for the best interests of AavegotchiDAO and the spirit of this proposal. There is an existing communication channel between Pixelcraft Studios and Skynet Lending that will continue to serve as the main comms channel throughout this contract’s term. The PPC shall attend weekly DAO meetings when summoned and answer any questions raised by DAO members at those meetings. The PPC role can be transferred from Pixelcraft leadership to another party at any time via a DAO Role Change Vote (DRCV).

The process is simple. Any DAO member can create a Motion to Change Roles and then make the case via a snapshot vote. If the voting power in favor of the motion exceeds 9 million, the role shall be changed. This threshold is high enough to discourage any practical attack vectors yet completely within the realm of possibility if the will to enact is widely supported by DAO participants.

*PART III: Order of Operations*

The 600,000 value of GHST will come from the DAO’s Liquidity Wallet (Polygon: 0x62DE034b1A69eF853c9d0D8a33D26DF5cF26682E). The Liquidity Wallet currently holds no GHST but still has roughly 2.3M USD of stablecoins, so we shall use the autoswappper contract developed in AGIP 69 to buy these 600,000 GHST.

Steps:

1: Directors shall send 700K USDC to the autoswapper contract.

2: Set the autoswapper’s buy amount to 6500 USDC and the buy interval to 2 Hours.

3: Execute the autoswapper. It shall accumulate 600k GHST in roughly 8 days.

3.1: IF 700k USDC is not enough to purchase 600k GHST, the Directors shall calculate how much additional USDC is required and send those funds to the autoswapper contract as well. Their discretion is enough for up to an additional 100k USDC required, but anything beyond that will require unanimous approval during a weekly DAO meeting. Even one dissenting vote (expressed by emojis in Discord) during that meeting would render additional funds unobtainable.

3.2: Any GHST accumulated beyond the required 600k shall remain on the Liquidity Wallet’s balances until the DAO decides some further actions for those funds.

4: Skynet Trading presents the final executable contract to the Signer for review.

5: If both the Signer finds the contract agreeable, the Signer shall sign.

5.1 If the Signer finds details in the contract not aligning with our CoreProp, the Signer shall not sign and instead the process will revert back to negotiations between all parties.

6: After signing, the Directors shall transfer 600k GHST to a wallet provided by Skynet Trading.

7: The Primary Point of Contact shall begin interfacing with Skynet Trading to confirm receipt of the 600k GHST and the beginning of executing liquidity support across four exchanges.

8: Skynet Trading shall provide a monthly report to the Primary Point of Contact who shall, in turn, share this report during the next weekly DAO call.

9: This process shall continue throughout the 12 month term of the contract.

10: Nearing the conclusion of the contract, Skynet Trading and the DAO can signal to each other whether or not each party wishes to re-engage for another agreement or not.

*Risks*

I believe that the loan to Skynet Trading presents minimal risk, given the company's financial stability and reputation in the industry.

Although Skynet Trading utilizes Fireblocks for institutional-grade custody solutions, risks associated with exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, HTX, and OKX remain present. It is important to note that Skynet Trading does not bear liability for any risks or losses incurred due to the operational aspects of these exchanges.

While not a direct risk, it is prudent to acknowledge the possibility of ‘seller’s remorse’ should GHST values significantly surpass the contract’s strike prices within the next 12 months. The strike prices, set as either premiums or averages of future market rates, are designed to align the interests of both parties. Both parties must enter this agreement with a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.

*Benefits*

The benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review: Improving liquidity on at least three additional exchanges improves the trading efficiency of the token.

Maturing the relationship with an industry-leading company like Skynet Trading may also lead to indirect benefits such as introductions to more exchanges and more opportunities for future loans related to on-chain DEX support and even perps markets (Skynet Trading is open to advocating for GHST perps and can make introductions).

*Conclusion*

For the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time for AavegotchiDAO to engage with Skynet Trading to improve the currently weak state of GHST liquidity on most of its current listed exchanges.

*VOTE:*

Should AavegotchiDAO provide a 600k GHST loan to Skynet Trading for 12 months?

### Staking 350 ETH with Lido and Acquiring rETH
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #111**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal aims to enhance the Aavegotchi DAO's treasury management through strategic staking, with a dual focus on accruing additional yield and increasing our Ethereum (ETH) holdings. We propose to engage in ETH staking through two prominent protocols, Lido and Rocket Pool, to achieve this objective.

*Details of the Proposal:*

1. Staking with Lido: We propose to stake 350 ETH directly with the Lido protocol. Lido currently offers an estimated yield of 3.7% per annum.

2. Acquiring rETH via Cowswap: Concurrently, we propose to swap an additional 350 ETH for Rocket Pool's rETH using Cowswap. Rocket Pool's yield is approximately 2.94% per annum.

3. Expected Returns: By adopting this strategy, we anticipate an annual yield of approximately 23.24 ETH, equating to a value of $70,000, based on the current ETH valuation of $3,000 per unit.

4. Risk Management: This approach also involves splitting our smart contract risk between Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest entities in the ETH staking ecosystem. This strategy aims to balance the pursuit of optimal yield (via Lido) with robust participation in the Ethereum ecosystem (via Rocket Pool).

5. Remaining Treasury Funds: Following this allocation, 537.96 ETH will remain unallocated within our treasury, available for other strategic initiatives or active management.

*Context and Financial Overview:*

* The Aavegotchi DAO presently holds 1237.96 ETH, acquired for $3,000,000 as per AGIP 103.

* The current market value of this holding is approximately $3.7 million, representing an unrealized gain of $700,000 since the approval of the core proposal on January 2, 2024.

* For transparency and ongoing monitoring, the DAO's treasury wallet is accessible at: [https://debank.com/profile/0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62](https://debank.com/profile/0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62).

*Conclusion:*

This proposal is crafted with a view to optimize the Aavegotchi DAO's asset management, leveraging the potential of ETH staking for yield generation, while maintaining a balanced and risk-aware approach.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1207008419844853760)

Option 1: Yes. Stake w/ Lido and buy rETH

Option 2: No. Don't stake or buy rETH

### Establishing an ETH Sell Ladder
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #112**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal is designed to strategically manage the Aavegotchi DAO's Ethereum (ETH) holdings by establishing a structured sell ladder. The aim is to maximize returns while mitigating the impacts of market volatility and psychology.

*Details of the Sell Ladder Proposal:*

1. First Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation exceeds $8,000 per unit.

2. Second Tranche: Sell another 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation above $10,000 per unit.

3. Third Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation surpasses $12,000 per unit.

4. Fourth Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation exceeding $15,000 per unit.

*Execution Strategy:*

• The sale of ETH should follow a specific order from the DAO's Ethereum treasury wallet:

• Begin with unstaked ETH.

• Proceed to rETH.

• If necessary, unstake stETH and sell the resulting ETH.

• All sold ETH will be exchanged for USDC (USD Coin).

• The acquired USDC will then be supplied to Aave, which currently offers over 1 billion USD in capacity.

*Rationale and Transparency:*

• This structured approach aims to provide clarity and predictability to DAO participants and investors.

• It helps in minimizing the influence of market psychology and speculative behavior, especially in a bullish market scenario.

• Assuming ETH reaches a valuation greater than $15,000 per unit, this strategy positions the Aavegotchi DAO to accumulate approximately $13.5 million in USDC, significantly enhancing returns on the initial $3 million investment in ETH.

*Conclusion:*

The proposed ETH sell ladder is a prudent financial strategy, offering the Aavegotchi DAO a methodical and transparent approach to realizing gains. It ensures that the DAO's assets are managed in a way that is both strategically sound and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1207008419844853760)

Option 1: Yes. Establish this sell ladder.

Option 2: No. Don't establish it.

### Gas Fee Reimbursement for DAO Directors
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #113**

**Proposal Summary:**

Hello friends !

As we all know, executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain comes with a cost, and these expenses can become a significant barrier to active participation.

In our collective journey towards better decentralized governance, it has come to our attention that gas fees can potentially hinder the smooth execution of transactions and introduce unintended competition among directors for transaction signing.

This proposal seeks to address this issue by giving 0.1 eth and 10 matic to each signer address for these essential transactions. When empty, directors can ask for a refill.

Signer addresses:

(Note : The directors will only use this gas to sign DAO TXs.)

(Note 2 : The directors will give back the remaining funds use for gas in case directors step down from their roles.)

(Note 3 "Retroactive gas reimbursement" : to be more equitable, the directors will be able to claim the funds used for transaction expenses that were funded by themselves before the date of the approval of this vote as core proposal.)

### FAKEwaar Continuing Development Fund
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #115**

**Proposal Summary:**

Do you hear the drums of waar, fren? It's time to find out who's FAKE strength is real. This adaptation of classic war card combat + 3-in-a-row, utilizing FAKEgotchis with a custom dynamic numerical model, enables deterministic gameplay with the existing asset library of FAKEgotchi NFTs.

*Whitepaper*

[https://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper](https://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper)

*Current Gameplay*

Two players, 1v1, 9 cards randomly selected from the FAKEgotchiDEX. High card wins. Winner is able to place their winning card on the battle board. Players are able to overtake an already placed card on the battle board if their card has a higher FAKE strength. Three in a row placed on the battle board provides additional bonus points at final score.

*Target Audience*

FAKEwaar is designed to provide a lightweight, casual, replayable gamification layer to the existing FAKEgotchi assets. It is meant for creators, collectors and everyone else who has yet to discover the cultural heartbeat of Aavegotchi: FAKEgotchis!

*Platform*

FAKEwaar is built in Unity with native networking. While a web hosted version is the primary focus, we will also be working hard to support ANDROID mobile users. Probably iOS as well.

*Request for Continuing Development Support*

V1 as presented during the March 30th, 2024 DAO call has been developed independently by GMI Game Labs. We humbly request additional support from the Aavegotchi DAO based on the demonstrated capabilities and potential of the V1 playable proof of concept.

*Timeline*

Upon approval and receipt of the requested continuing development fund, FAKEwaar V2 would be planned for a three month development timeline. This fund would allow GMI Game Labs to put full time effort into this development and we fully anticipate fulfilling or even beating this timeline. A full overview of V2 implementations can be found in the [FAKEwaar Whitepaper](https://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper).

*Requested Funding*

Total Cost: 18K USD

Breakdown:

* 6K - Unity Development & Project Management by Mycaleum

* 6K - Website, Smart Contract and Technical Support by User Default

* 6K - Creative leadership of asset and art generation by Kravitch

Upon approval, we request $18k USD equivalent in stablecoins (USDC/USDT/DAI) to be transferred to the GMI Multisig Treasury on Polygon PoS at: 0x376184461aaa5Bd445cd52924Fdf29e8E4b86900

In the event the DAO does not have on-hand stablecoin liquidity on Polygon PoS to fulfill this disbursement, we request an appropriate amount of $GHST tokens be swapped in order to provide this stablecoin liquidity in full.

### Proposal to Add Liquidity on Aerodrome and earn AERO
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #118**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal seeks to strengthen the Aavegotchi ecosystem by increasing liquidity on Aerodrome, Base's native decentralized exchange (DEX). By adding $500K worth of $GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum to a liquidity pool on Aerodrome, we aim to deepen liquidity and attract more users to the platform. Additionally, we propose allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives to further encourage participation and engagement.

*Rationale:*

Increasing Liquidity: With GHST recently launching on Base, we have a responsibility to help ensure adequate liquidity for traders on Base. The proposed allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum into a liquidity pool on Aerodrome will significantly improve the depth of liquidity for trading on Base. This will allow for more efficient trading and reduce price slippage, making the Aavegotchi ecosystem more attractive to both existing and potential users.

Incentivizing Participation: By allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives, we aim to encourage more users to engage with the Aavegotchi ecosystem on Aerodrome. These incentives will be distributed as rewards for veAERO holders in exchange for them voting to increase the allocation of AERO rewards for the GHST-ETH pool.

Earning AERO token for the DAO treasury: Aerodrome is the leading native DEX on Base, and with Aavegotchi making inroads into Base and Gotchichain settling to Base, it makes sense for the DAO to have a stake in the chain’s success. Since Base does not have a native token, tokens like AERO can be seen as proxies for the chain’s growth.

*Proposal Details:*

Allocation of Funds: The proposal calls for the allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum from the AavegotchiDAO treasury to be used for creating a liquidity pool on Aerodrome.

Distribution of Incentives: The proposal also includes the allocation of 100K GHST of bribe incentives to be distributed among veAERO holders on Aerodrome. These incentives should be distributed in two tranches of 50K GHST each over a period of one month.

Implementation Timeline: The proposal aims to have the liquidity pool established and the bribe incentives ready for distribution within 14 days of the proposal's approval. The AavegotchiDAO foundation should be responsible for overseeing the implementation process and ensuring that all necessary steps are completed in a timely manner.

Source of funds: $500K worth of ETH should be sourced by converting DAI from the DAO Liquidity wallet into ETH. $500K worth of GHST should be obtained by reducing the DAO’s 80-20 LP on Balancer to obtain enough GHST. Both GHST and ETH should be bridged from Ethereum to Base via the canonical Superbridge or Base Bridge (whichever is easiest).

### Convert all DAO-owned $DAI/$aDAI -> $USDC/$aUSDC
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #119**

**Proposal Summary:**

AavegotchiDAO holds a range of treasury assets according to the mandate laid out in AGIP65 which outlined a 4-way split for unlocked $DAI for liquidity, general reserve, core team, and player rewards.

As of April 1st 2024, our stablecoin basket is as follows:

* ~5.8million USD worth

* 87.3% in $DAI/$aDAI; remaining in $USDC

*Motivation:*

An ecosystem change at MakerDAO is recently introducing some additional risk to $DAI with the consideration of including algorithmic stablecoin $USDE and $sUSDE as collateral to borrow $DAI against, with a cap being considered up to $1 billion USD.

This move is indicative of a growing trend where DeFi protocols seek to capture additional yield for users and controversially increase instability risks of the underlying assets in return. With our own DAO stablecoin holdings denominated largely in $DAI I think it is time to shed this risk by converting all our DAI into less risky stablecoins. It is encouraged voters learn more on the MakerDAO situation in the URLs listed at the bottom of this vote.

*Voting Material:*

I am proposing we convert all treasury assets held in $DAI and $aDAI into $USDC and $aUSDC, respectively. All assets will remain on their current networks unless bridged elsewhere on a different vote. With some research on 3-month yields it looks like there will be minimal impact on our interest accrued if we swap all $aDAI -> $aUSDC. This can be seen from a Dune Analytics chart below.

If passed, the acting AavegotchiDAO Treasurer and Foundation multi-sig directors should follow the below recommendations when swapping:

* Withdraw all $DAI tokens deposited into Aave & Issue two tranches of swaps to USDC on https://swap.cow.fi/. Then re-deposit all USDC from aDAI equivalents back into the Aave Ethereum V3 Market for address 0x53…7B62.

* For affected addresses on Polygon issue one swap from DAI -> USDC for both addresses 0x93…631c & 0x8c…90f6 on https://curve.fi/ .

* For the remaining DAI in wallet 0xFF…8020 please follow the swap instructions above for Polygon on Curve.fi and swap to USDC.

*Total DAI Holdings and Wallets*

DAO Foundation Treasury

* 15,809 DAI - 0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62 ; Ethereum

* 3,557,579 aDAI - 0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62 ; Ethereum

* 193,490 DAI - 0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c ; Polygon

Remaining Bonding Curve Fees (Ethereum)

* 275,825 DAI - 0xFFE6280ae4E864D9aF836B562359FD828EcE8020

DAO Foundation Rewards Pool (Polygon)

* 9 DAI - 0x8c8E076Cd7D2A17Ba2a5e5AF7036c2b2B7F790f6

Total – 4,042,712 DAI

### Allocation of Aerodrome POL Rewards
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #120**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal is a followup on the successful passing of AGIP 118 - Proposal to Add Liquidity on Aerodrome and earn AERO. This proposal applies retroactively to the rewards we are currently accruing.

Currently, any AERO that is earned by the DAO via the Aerodrome liquidity flywheel cannot be allocated because the terms were not in the original proposal.

This prop proposes to allocate any AERO earned by our POL (protocol-owned liquidity) on Aerodrome in the following way:

20% converted to ETH 80% added to the GHST/WETH liquidity pool incentives for the next epoch

These transactions should be carried out within seven (7) days of receiving the AERO, unless extenuating circumstances cause delays.

The proposed length for this allocation is three months. After three months, a new proposal will be drafted and submitted to AavegotchiDAO to either continue the allocation as is, or make changes.

Thank you for your consideration frens!

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1224594975673684018).

This proposal solicits support for a Mid-Tier Sponsorship of MCON3. Whereby the funds will go towards executing the main event, as well as supporting a dedicated side event for Aavegotchi.

This 10k ticket covers staff/organizers, food, AV/ furnishings, tickets for the whole team as well as $2500 allocated to a Gotchi exclusive side event that the MCON organizers will help organize and promote amongst locals and OGs.

As a part of this experience Aavegotchi would be able to co-create the gaming track, pick topics of discussion, invite speakers to share their perspectives, and have a dedicated side event, social media spotlight, as well as all of our branding on the events marketing and media + logistical support from the MetaCartel to bring it all together.

The DAO arcade machine is needed to coordinate a successful side event where we can set up and interact with people playing it at Off-World Arcade. After sponsorship is approved by the DAO, more details can be laid out as we co-create a gaming track, tournament or game jam.

We’d need a paid team of at least 3 GotchiGang/Greetors (setup, breakdown, BD, media) and would prefer a PC representative and/or a DAO funded game dev to attend as well. Stickers, merch and other physical goods for marketing/signage and rewards for email captures for mailing lists would also need to be discussed, funded and produced.

IF we do a game jam/hack focused side-event we need to consider qualified judges, discuss prizes for winners as well as rewards for any tournaments. Or just showcase Aavegotchi games and the arcade machine, run a few tournaments and onboard new DAO members, artists, and devs.

Final costs could range from 13-15K total (likely less), but we’d be saving funds by collaborating alongside MetaCartel to produce and market a successfully spicy Aavegotchi DAO side-event.

*MILESTONES*

* Email signups, Social Media Spotlight

* Games Developed

* Dapps built for DAO governance and tooling

* GotchiPill community governerds, investors, gamers and game devs.

* Live discussions featuring Aavegotchi DAO members

*RISKS*

Gotchichain not ready, readiness of playable Aavegotchi web3 connected games, Arcade machine progress, overspending budget. Not being a sponsoring partner and missing out on the spicy fun.

*CONCLUSION*

Members from Aavegotchi DAO with personal connections and history with the MetaCartel have already proven to be valuable. Through these bonds we were given an opportunity for a last minute free booth at ETH Denver 2023 and are getting the top tier(20k) perks for sponsorship at the mid-tier(10K) cost for MCON3.

The proposed $10K sponsorship will leverage existing relationships with MetaCartel to achieve top-tier sponsorship benefits at a mid-tier cost. The additional estimated available budget from GotchiGreetors (3-5k) ensures logistical support for a successful event. This collaboration is expected to strengthen long-term relationships and create significant impact at MCON III!

$10K paid for in USDC or EVM-Native Token on MAINNET sent to MetaCartel Safe eth: 0xc70c7090b91e0d9861d734Eb613761e8b35224D2

### Allocation of Quickswap POL Rewards
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #122**

**Proposal Summary:**

We have significant Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) on Quickswap (Polygon network), which is accumulating over $250k in fees (GHST and USDC). Unlike Balancer POL, these fees do not compound automatically and need to be claimed manually.

This proposal seeks to determine the best course of action for these accumulated fees. Below are the options we have identified:

* Do Nothing: Leave the fees unclaimed and unutilized.

* Compound Monthly: Allow the directors to claim and compound the fees every month by re-adding the rewards to the QuickSwap pool on the Polygon network.

* Bridge and Add to Liquidity on Base Network: Bridge the rewards to the Base network and add them to the GHST-WETH liquidity pool on Aerodrome.

* Bridge and Use as Incentives on Base Network: Bridge the rewards to the Base network and use them as incentives for bribing the GHST-WETH pool on Aerodrome. These incentives will be distributed over a period of two months (8 epochs) with equal allocation for each epoch.

*Implementation Timeline:*

These transactions should be carried out within seven (7) days of reaching a decision, unless extenuating circumstances cause delays.

*Voting Options*

* Do Nothing

* Compound Monthly on Quickswap (Polygon network)

* Bridge to Base and Add to GHST-WETH Liquidity Pool on Aerodrome

* Bridge to Base and Use as Incentives for GHST-WETH Pool on Aerodrome (2 Months, 8 Epochs with Equal Allocation Each Epoch)

Thank you for your consideration frens!

### Community Wearable Schematics Release
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #123**

**Proposal Summary:**

* Frens and Accessories Wearables Launch

* Theme is community-designed

* 14 new designs ranging from common to mythical

* Eyes, face, and pets only

* No new cores to be minted/released

* Aimed to balance the trait meta and freshen up the wearables pool

* 12 unique designs. The common, uncommon, and rare pet would be evolutions of each other

* Target release: end of September 2024 (sooner if PC has bandwidth for the push)

*Community Competition*

Anyone can design a wearable and submit their artwork in any format. The winners will be chosen during a hangout in traditional emoji-response fashion

I will work with the winners to make sure the pieces are in proper pixel-perfect format

Prize money ranges from 100 ghst to 500 ghst

Bonus GHST prizes for whoever makes the best use of old wearables in set creation. The sets should strive to pick up older wearables as well as fill the gaps as shown here: [https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html](https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html)

Bonus GHST for the #1 favourite wearable

*Partnerships*

Partnerships are always a great idea and welcomed. However they take quite a bit of time and coordination. Therefore, I propose we open this aspect with a bounty. Anyone who can successfully bridge our community with another favourable gang can grab a nice 500 GHST bounty. Keep in mind it's important in a partnership for reciprocity. Partnering goes beyond simply doing something for another community while receiving nothing in return.

Partnership connections must be established by 15th June. The deal may not need to be closed, but we need to be 80% committed to it. This is because partnership-specific wearables are limited in their design scope (we don't want to have people designing a wearable for a slot that gets filled with a partnership!)

*Timeline*

* Proposal raised and voting period 29th May - 15th June

* Partnership bounty deadline 15th June

* Design submissions deadline 28th June

* Competition voting 29th June

* Artwork refinement 30th June - 20th July

* Handoff all completed pieces to PC 20th July

* PC does their magic 20th July - release ???

*Distribution & Mint*

No new cores will be minted.

The traits are pulled from here: [https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html](https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html)

The bigger the standard deviation, the further from balance that particular slot/rarity is. There are clear winners in every slot. For uncommon eye, there is no imbalance, so we propose two items which counter-balance each other.

The DAO will buy a basket of cores from the market and forge a number of pieces to use as giveaways or sales

I propose a budget of 8,000 GHST to buy/forge as many pieces as possible. The goal is the following quantities:

* Common eye & face: 50 ea

* Common pet: 25

* Uncommon eye & face: 25 ea

* Uncommon pet: 15

* Rare faces: 10 ea

* Rare pet: 5

* no legendary or mythical

The total maximum alloy required is 72k which will be provided by the DAO stock. Any remaining alloy / ghst from this allotment will be returned. Any schematics obtained through smelting will be added to the geode pool.

All remaining schematics from the mint will be added to the geode pool.

Forged wearables will be sent to the DAO.

*Total Costs*

* Core buying: 8000 GHST

* Prize pool: 2650 GHST

* Oliver for coordination, communication, and wearable rigging: 2600 GHST

* Partnership bounties: 500ea (to be distributed later upon success)

Total: 13,250 GHST + successful partnership bounties (as this number is unknown, we will send this separately)

Upon successful passing of prop, send 13,250 GHST and 72,000 alloy to: 0x4a478E4593A5D557dB640642c34Ae52800084451

This is a clean wallet which can be tracked for all buying / smelting.

As mentioned, all unspent GHST and alloy will be returned to the DAO.

*Closing*

Overall, my hope is to have a fun event which brings the community together. The last design competition was a hit and there were so many great wearables designed. By opening up the design to more possibilities, we will have more winners. I also would love to see some old wearables freshened up in new creative ways with the addition of one or two new items :smile:

With more games on the horizon, RF, and the Battler, players are going to need different wearables to win the meta.

More option = more alloy burning = floors rising.

Thanks everyone and let's have some fun!

### Fund Creation of Ghostly Gladiator MVP
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #124**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal is for funding an MVP of Ghostly Gladiator, a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler based on the assets & lore of the Gotchiverse. The long-term goals of the project are:

# 1 Create a great roguelike deck-builder, in order to

# 2 increase the exposure of crypto-agnostic & crypto-ignorant gamers to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and

# 3 provide a long-term income stream to the DAO through a community meta-progression system (see the Monetization section of the design doc for details on this part: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit?usp=sharing))

Ghostly Gladiator is targeted towards people who don’t know about Aavegotchi yet and maybe don’t even have a crypto wallet. Rather than try to monetize the (currently) small number of people that both own Aavegotchi assets and want to play minigames with them, this project is designed to appeal to the wider gaming audience and expose them to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and community. For those who like to ask ‘wen marketing’, my answer is ‘right now’. In marketing speak this game is targeted towards the top of the marketing funnel rather than the very bottom like many of the minigames so far have been.

I am asking for $6500 worth of DAI or GHST to fund the creation of the MVP over 6 weeks, with plans for a larger proposal later if the project is successful with the community. At the end of the 6-week period I would run a small XP event for the community to try out the MVP.

Ghostly Gladiator (title not final) is a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler. For a game in the same genre, see Fights in Tight Spaces (or Knights in Tight Spaces). Fisht Fight ([https://zygoth.itch.io/fisht-fight](https://zygoth.itch.io/fisht-fight)) is a simple example of this genre that I made for a 7-day game jam, and it’s the concept and code that I will be building from. Fisht Fight placed 11th out of 564 entries in the ‘Fun’ category in the Fish Fest game jam (top 2%). I highly recommend that you play Fisht Fight if you want an idea of how Ghostly Gladiator will play.

*Basic Gameplay*

The game is divided into 10 separate battles, each with different types of monsters. Each turn, the player draws 5 cards from their deck and receives 3 energy. They can use the energy to play cards from their hand in order to move around the battlefield, attack enemies, defend, summon allies, etc. Battles end when all enemies are defeated. After each battle, the player gets to pick a new card from 3 options to add to their deck. The game ends when the player completes all battles (victory) or loses all their HP.

*Timeline (6 weeks)*

Programming (Zygo)

* Refactor code from Fisht Fight (3 days)

* Save/load system (5 days)

* Basic CMP system, accept user donations to unlock new features (5 days)

* 10 new cards to unlock with the CMP system (3 days)

* Integrate new art (3 days)

* Title screen (1 day)

* UI improvements for increased clarity (3 days)

* Tutorial (3 days)

* Bug fixing (3 days)

* System to record player crypto address for an XP event (2 days)

Total: 31 days of work

Art (Admurin)

* New battle background

* Beta art for all cards

* Title screen art

* Reskin main character as Aavegotchi and enemies as different types of Lickuidators

* New Battle tile sprites

* Card sprite

* Various UI icons like draw/discard pile, card energy icon, block icon, etc.

Music (Mario Sello)

* Title theme

* Battle music

* Win & lose fanfares

SFX (Zygo)

* Use sounds from Zygo’s sound library & tools like LabChirp/SFXR

*Key performance indicators*

The game will be hosted on Itch.io, so to begin with the KPIs will be the analytics that they offer. (daily views and plays) In addition, during the XP event the amount of unique crypto addresses that users submit will be a KPI for this proposal. Eventually tracking unique users, time played, and donations would be useful but these are out of scope for the MVP.

*Effect*

Send $6500 in DAI to address 0xF0Bc763e0A6AF4784a36fa102220FF60eC651f9e to fund the development of the MVP, including programming, pixel art, and music. This should be sent soon after the completion of the core prop so I can pay the pixel artist & composer up front.

Schedule an XP event for the week of August 21-28. Since the game won’t be interfacing with the blockchain directly, XP credit tracking would be via an in-game form that shows up after a successful run. Players would submit their wallet address and a list of these addresses would be submitted to the DAO at the conclusion of the event. I chose this method because successful runs last about an hour, which would make farming XP for many gotchis individually take a prohibitive amount of time.

*Completing this proposal will provide the following benefits:*

* Create the MVP for a free-to-play game in a popular genre that can appeal to non-crypto gamers and thus bring new players to the Aavegotchi ecosystem.

* Host an XP event to give Aavegotchi holders an opportunity to try out the game and give feedback

* Create a base from which I can build mechanisms that will eventually self-fund the game and bring income to the DAO. (see the Monetization section in the design doc for more details on this: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit))

*Acknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences*

* Risk: the game is not finished or is completed poorly

* Mitigations: I have a record of completing jam games and also projects much larger than 1 month; I also have a strong incentive to finish the MVP so I can continue working on the project in the future. Even if this were to occur, the amount of DAI committed to this MVP is small, so the risk of wasting funds is low.

*Any alternative paths (Plan B, Plan C, etc)*

Not sure what to put here, I always have ideas for other games but this is the one I feel most confident about.

*About Me*

Hi! I’m Zygo, a game developer that has been involved with Aavegotchi since Haunt 1. I’ve always been interested in making games, and in the last 2 years I’ve been doing it full time. In February of 2024 I released Spellstrife on Steam after 14 months of work ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/2385240/Spellstrife/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2385240/Spellstrife/)). Since then, I’ve been doing game jams to practice quick development and test out some of my ideas. See my Itch.io page for my game jam games: [https://zygoth.itch.io/](https://zygoth.itch.io/) . I’m most familiar with the Phaser3 engine.
