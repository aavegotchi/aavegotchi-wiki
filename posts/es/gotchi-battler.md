## Trait Mapping

There are 9 core stats that are used in Gotchi Battler, these stats are mapped from the Aavegotchi's 6 on-chain [traits](/traits) (NRG, AGG, SPK, BRN, EYC, EYS) as follows:

## Speed/Turn Mechanics

In order to determine which Gotchi is to act each turn a counter for each Gotchi is stored called the Action Delay. The Gotchi with the lowest Action Delay at the start of each turn will be the one to act that turn, if multiple Gotchis have the same Action Delay then the Gotchi with the highest Speed stat will act. If multiple Gotchis have the same Action Delay and the same Speed stat then one of those Gotchis is randomly chosen to act.

The formula for calculating the initial Action Delay is:

```
100 / Speed
```

After a Gotchis has acted its current Action Delay is calculated by 100 / Speed and added to their existing Action Delay.

## Attacking

In Gotchi Battler, battles are automated, allowing players to watch the action unfold based on the strengths, abilities, and tactics of their assembled teams.
