Geist is a new L3 powered by Base, Arbitrum, Alchemy, and Aavegotchi.

Geist is built to be the onchain home of Aavegotchi, the Aavegotchi Gaming Console, and all of our official and community-built games. Games or dapps that include Aavegotchi elements (tokens, NFTs, tooling, lore) will be prioritized for deployment.

## Funcionalidades

Geist is built using the cutting-edge Arbitrum stack, the leading rollup chain stack for crypto gaming. Standard benefits of the Arbitrum stack such as <250ms block time, custom gas token ([GHST](/ghst)), and permissionless transacting all apply.

Hereâ€™s what sets Geist apart:

- **A chain-wide membership program.** Geist Members will enjoy exclusive access to reward campaigns across all games on the chain. Non-members can still transact and play games on the chain, but will miss out on many of the benefits.

- **World-class Uptime and the Complete Developer Platform.** Powered by Alchemy, the leader in blockchain infrastructure, Geist offers high uptime and familiar developer tools such as Token API, Transaction API, and Webhooks.

- **Native NFT Marketplace.** Geist supports the Aavegotchi [Baazaar](/marketplace), a fully onchain NFT marketplace with royalties enabled.

- **CEX Onramps.** Geist is collaborating closely with Coinbase and other CEXes to allow for ETH and GHST onramps.

- **Native VRF.** Geist supports a native onchain random number generator (VRF) developed by Pixelcraft Studios, allowing game developers to deliver provable randomness to their players.

- **Account Abstraction and Gasless Relayers.** Geist supports the latest in account abstraction, smart wallets, and gasless transactions, powered by Thirdweb.

- **Native Staking with revenue sharing.** Pending a future [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) proposal, Geist will support staking GHST to earn a portion of both marketplace and sequencer fees.

- **Permissioned contract deployment.** To prevent network congestion and ensure quality control.

## Polter Testnet

The Polter Testnet, the official testnet of Geist, is the testing ground for all Aavegotchi asset migrations and features.
