## Functies

### AERIAL COMBAT

SPIRIT FORCE ARENA features unique vertical and asymmetrical combat where all players are free to fly whilst avoiding a floating force of enemies roaming the map. As matches progress so too do the rising FOMO levels ultimately pushing all players upwards into a showdown on the roof.

### BLADES & BULLETS

SPIRIT FORCE ARENA features a unique combat toggle allowing fans of both long-range gunplay and close-quarters melee to feel at home. Switch between each easily mid-match to deal devastating combos or stick to one style and dominate.

### CROSS-GAME PROGRESSION

With a single login across all of our Aavegotchi experiences, players are free to progress their Profile with the speed and style they wish. Earn Badges from any of the supported titles to level up your Profile, and unlock rewards such as Tokens, Profile Customization, Combat Consumables, and Emotes.

### FARM & EARN

Land owners within the Gotchiverse can farm Alchemica tokens such as Alpha, Fud, Fomo, and Kek. These can then be spent alongside crafting materials collected from matches to buy Potions and Protolicks that then give a brief advantage during matches. Gear up therefore and join $GHST matches to have a better chance of earning the prize pot from all players!

### CREATE-A-CHAMPION

Purchase a Gotchi to create your own playable character that can be used in any of our supported titles! Kit them out with apparel, combat items, and pets to make them feel strong and look cool. Then hangout with frens or head into battle and make a name for yourself within the Aavegotchi community!

### CROSS-PLAY

Play SPIRIT FORCE ARENA on Windows, MacOS, or Linux! Play a game on PC, earn rewards, then go use or view them on another device or platform.
