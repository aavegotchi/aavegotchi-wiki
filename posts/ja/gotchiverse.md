</div>

人間のレルム（＝領域）の向こうには、暗い森の奥に潜むスマートコントラクトがきらめくイーサーレルムがあります。 さらにその奥へ進むと、「ゴッチバース（Gotchiverse）」と呼ばれるレルムがあります。 イーサーレルムでイールド・ファーマーがリキデート（＝清算）されると、その魂はゴッチバースに旅立ち、Aavegotchiとして生まれ変わるのです。 Aavegotchiは、[レアリティー・ファーミング](/rarity-farming)、[投票](/dao)、そして仲間との糞投稿をこよなく愛する妖怪のような種族です。

ゴッチバースはほんの一握りのAavegotchiで始まりましたが、リキデーション化がイーサーレルム内で進むにつれ、ゴッチバースの人口は急増し、何千ものAavegotchiがその広大な土地を探索、建築、定住し、さらには彼らの創造主であるリキデーター（lickquidator）を崇拝するために大きな建造物を建設しています。

## ゾーン

ゴッチバースは広大な国土を持ち、その地形には重要なランドマークが点在しています。 3つのゾーンに分かれています：

* シタデル
* グリッド
* ビヨンド

### シタデル

リッキデーターを排除するフォースフィールドに守られたシタデルは、ゴッチバースにおけるAavegotchiの本拠地である。 シタデルには、グレートポータル周辺の特別な場所を除いて、塔を建てることはできない。

#### グレートポータル

シタデルの重要なランドマークの一つ、グレートポータルである。 グレートポータルは、ゴッチバースと人間レルムを結ぶ架け橋となる、魔法のような建造物である。 グレートポータルの中には、これまでに存在したすべてのAavegotchiの魂が渦巻いている。 グレートポータルはゴッチバースのシタデルを保護し、その見返りとしてゴッチバースから収穫される[ゴッチュスアルケミカ](/gotchiverse#gotchus-alchemica)の一部を受け取っている。

### グリッド

グリッドは、シタデルの外側のすべてのことを言います。 グリッド内の区画はより豊かなのですが、区画の所有者はいたるところにリッキデーターが潜んでいるので注意が必要です。 グリッドの区画は、ウォールとタワーの両方を建設することができます。

#### アリーナ
グリッドの重要なランドマークのひとつアリーナです。

Aavegotchiは友好的ですが、攻撃的な衝動は発散しないといけないことがわかっており、そのためにアリーナを作りました。

アリーナ内では、十分な[スピリットフォース](/spirit-force)を持つAavegotchi（Aaveの力を持つ利子を得られるトークン）同士が、相手のスピリットフォースを奪い合う壮大なバトルロワイアルで戦える。

リッキデーターはアリーナには近づこうとはしませんが、ファンタスティック・グラウンド方面はファイアーフレンドリーなエリアでリッキデーターがはびこっている。

### ビヨンド

第2幕（アクト2）が始まるまで解錠されないロックされた区画。

## 地区

Districts comprise of groups of REALM parcels that are situated close to each other. The following image shows a portion of the Citaadel where REALM parcels have been released and the districts in it.

Guilds generally organize themselves in districts. Check out the [Guild page](/guild) for the list of Guilds and which districts they are situated in.

<img src="/gotchiverse/aavegotchi-districts.png" alt="Aavegotchi Districts" />

Browse the REALM here at [gotchiverse.io](https://gotchiverse.io/).

## レルム区画サイズ

Parcels come in three sizes, with each size providing greater deposits of Alchemica* and more building space

* Humble: Contain smol deposits of Alchemica and building space (8 x 8 pixels)
* Reasonably Sized: Contain reasonable deposits of Alchemica and building space (16 x 16 pixels)
* Spacious: Contain huge deposits of Alchemica and building space (32 x 64 pixels)

*Exact Material amounts are calculated by [Chainlink VRF](/glossary#chainlink-vrf) upon purchase.

Some parcels will be next to or adjacent to Alchemica deposits. These parcels will see farming boosters indicated on the gotchiverse dashboard and when they are listed on the Baazaar.

To make it more human frenly, each parcel will be assigned with a unique three word combination. This is in addition to the TokenID. Users will be able to use the search box on the Gotchiverse site to specifically filter for parcels with the word or words they are looking for.

## レルムゲームプレイ

<div class="headerImageContainer">
<img src="/gotchiverse/lickquidator.gif" class="headerImage" alt="Lickquidator">
<p class="headerImageText">Lickquidator</p>
</div>

Owners of REALM parcels can employ their Aavegotchis (and those of others) to farm their REALM parcels, producing quantities of resources known as Gotchus Alchemica. These resources can be combined to create powerful structures known as [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels).

The Gotchiverse is an open-ended social space where players can engage in myriad activities, such as farming, crafting, trading, and combat.

Although there are no victory conditions or “end of game” scenarios, one overarching goal of the Gotchiverse is to collect Alchemica to bolster your parcel to produce more yield, and build defensive structures in preparation for the coming of the Prophecy, and the great lickquidators invasion.

Players that possess Lickquidator Credits can opt to play as lickquidators. Lickquidator Credits can be earned by completing tasks, referring friends, participating in airdrops, or other ways. They can also be purchased with [GHST](/ghst).

The main goal of a lickquidator is to collect loose Alchemica that has been spilled around the Gotchiverse, but they can also engage in combat with Aavegotchis and offensive Installations to earn Alchemica.

Lickquidators are envisioned as a free-to-play entry point to the Gotchiverse Realm, with no cap on supply and limited collectability.

There is also a [Gotchi Lending](/gotchi-lending) feature that allows Gotchi owners to lend out their Gotchis to other players for a set period of time to try out the game.

## ゴッチバースでの交流

Aavegotchis love socializing with their frens, and their favorite place to hang out is inside the Gotchiverse!

By default, text chat will be enabled for all Gotchis in proximity to each other. REALM Parcel owners can also construct special Installations on their parcels to enable voice chat for Gotchis within a Parcel, and upgrade the Installation to support global voice chat.

Gotchis can also band together to go on Aadventures together, exploring dungeons, fighting lickquidators and other baaddies to earn rewards. Aadventures are special regions outside of the main Gotchiverse where Aavegotchis can put their [traits](/traits) and [wearables](/wearables) to work while exploring, battling NPC enemies, and gaining experience and resources. But they don’t last forever!

## チャットコマンド

The following table shows the chat commands in the Gotchiverse.

table_chatCommands

## Gotchus Alchemica

**Gotchus Alchemica** (ERC20 tokens) are the four elements of the Gotchiverse: Fud, Fomo, Alpha, and Kek. They can be combined to craft Installations and Aesthetica, among other uses. Read more about the tokenomics [here](/gotchus-alchemica).

<img class="bodyImage" src="/gotchiverse/gotchus-alchemica.png" alt="Gotchus Alchemica" />

The table below shows their total supply:

table_gotchusAlchemicaSupply

Gotchus Alchemica can be extracted from REALM in four distinct ways:

* **Alchemical Channeling**:  A basic daily stipend earned by Aavegotchis that comes directly from the Gotchiverse ether, instead of being harvested from the parcel.
* **Communal Channeling**: Aavegotchis can also collectively channel Alchemica when a Gotchi Lodge Installation has been built upon the REALM Parcel. In order to participate in communal channeling, the Aavegotchi must be wearing the associated Guild Insignia and be present on the REALM Parcel during the ritual. For every additional Aavegotchi participating in the Communal Channeling ritual, Alchemica will be farmed more rapidly.
* **Farming**: Once a Harvester has been built, Alchemica begin accruing passively, with x amount going into the Reservoir, **y** amount spilling over to the nearby map, and **z** amount going to the Great Portal
* **Harvesting**: Aavegotchis and lickquidators can roam the map, collecting loose Alchemica spilled from mining.

Trading of Gotchus Alchemica will take place on the [Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange).

### Average Alchemica Per Parcel

Similar to the “Portal” mechanic in Aavegotchi, REALM Parcels must be surveyed before they finally reveal the quantity of Alchemica that rests inside them. The surveying process is an onchain call to Chainlink VRF, a truly randomized number generator.

When the Gotchiverse is released, all existing REALM Parcels can be surveyed if their owners choose to, or the surveying process can be delayed until a future date.

The range of Alchemica available for each Parcel Type is listed below, for the entire Act 1, and for Round 1 of Act 1, which distributes roughly 25% of the Alchemica contained within.

*Note that total Alchemica within a Parcel is **cumulative**, which means future Surveyings will add additional Alchemica on top of the total.*

table_avgBaseAlchemicaPerParcelAct1Total

table_avgBaseAlchemicaPerParcelAct1FirstRound

### Surveying Alchemica Range

The range of possible Alchemica that can be discovered during each surveying round. To prevent a bad player experience, the “minimum” that can be surveyed is 20% of the average, and the “maximum” is 1.8x of the average.

For example, the range of values of FUD for a Humble parcel for the entire Act 1 will be 5694 to 51251, averaging out to 28,473.

We believe this provides for interesting gameplay, while also providing a sufficient “safety net” for even the unluckiest of players.

## レルム区画での建築

**Installations** are special structures built on top of your REALM Parcel. Installations are crafted via various combinations of Alchemica, and can be freely traded for GHST in the [Aavegotchi Baazaar](/baazaar).

Confirmed Installations include:

table_installations

Installations take a certain number of blockchain blocks to finish constructing, but this time can be reduced by spending GLTR (GAX Liquidity Token Reward), an in-game currency that can be earned by providing liquidity on the Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX).

**Aesthetica** are aesthetic NFTs that can be added to a Parcel, but do not affect its Alchemica or other statistics. They just look dope.

### インスタレーションの特性とレシピ

**Recipes**

Crafting Installations and upgrading them to become more powerful is an important part of the Gotchiverse experience. Different Installations require different “recipes” to craft and upgrade, which is why the Aadepts provided us with a handy Recipe Book for reference! You can find the latest Recipes [here](https://github.com/aavegotchi/gotchiverse-bible/blob/main/RecipeBook.pdf).

Installations and their upgrades also have a “Craft Time”, which is measured in blocks on the Polygon network. One block equals roughly 2.2 seconds in human time. Most (but not all) Level 1 Installations have a craft time of “Instant”, which means they are crafted immediately, while those with craft times longer than “Instant” will enter into a crafting queue and get sent to their owner upon completion.

This crafting/upgrading process can be accelerated by spending an in-game currency currently known as [GLTR](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token). GLTR can be acquired by providing liquidity between GHST and Gotchus Alchemica tokens on the [Gotchus Alchemica Exchange](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange).

**Harvest Rate, Capacity, and Spillover**

Haarvesters and Reservoirs are special Installations that allow mining of Alchemica from beneath the Gotchiverse surface.

Each type of Haarvester is capable of harvesting one type of Alchemica, and each Reservoir can hold a certain amount of one type of Alchemica. As the Installation level increases, Harvest Rate and Capacity both increase.

**Spillover** is another property of Reservoirs that determines how much and how far Alchemica spills when it is claimed from the Reservoir. Lower level Reservoirs have higher Spillover Amount and Spillover Radius, and these amounts are reduced with further upgrades.

You can consult the Recipe Book [here](https://github.com/aavegotchi/gotchiverse-bible/blob/main/RecipeBook.pdf) to see exact Harvest Rates, Capacities, and Spillover Rates.

**Removing Installations**

Once an Installation is added to a Parcel, it can be upgraded or removed. Removing the Installation destroys the underlying NFT, but returns 50% of all Alchemica spent on the Installation and its upgrades to the original owner.

### クラフティングの収益分配

Whenever an Installation, upgrade or other item is crafted within the Gotchiverse, the underlying Alchemica are sent to four distinct places:

* Great Portal (35%)
* Pixelcraft (30%)
* DAO (30%)
* Burn (5%)

**The Great Portal** is the heartbeat of the Gotchiverse. Whenever items are crafted in the Gotchiverse, 35% of that Alchemica is captured by the most important Portal in the game. As the Great Portal’s treasury balloons, a great prophecy waits to be fulfilled…

*Supply in excess of the capacity will be redistributed via Alchemical Channeling, instead of minting new tokens.*

Any Alchemica in excess of the Great Portal Capacity will be recycled back into the ecosystem via Alchemical and Group Channeling, slowing the minting rate for new tokens.

Initially, the Great Portal Capacity will be 1% of total supply, but this can be altered by AavegotchiDAO. Speaking of AavegotchiDAO…

**AavegotchiDAO**, the governing body of the Aavegotchi Protocol, receives 30% of the crafted Alchemica split. This Alchemica balance represents a powerful opportunity for the community to have a direct stake in treasury management and put these tokens to work on the protocol’s behalf.

**Pixelcraft Studios**, the Gotchiverse’s dev house, also receives 30% of crafted Alchemica. These Alchemica balances can quickly be put to work in any endeavor supporting the growth of the Aavegotchi protocol and Gotchiverse game. Besides just diamond-handing, user acquisition, strategic allocations and marketing initiatives are some of the ways Alchemica can be put to work.

**A 5% token burn** is the cherry on top of this Crafting Revenue Distribution plan. A burn of this significance will help to offset the various ebbs and flows of Alchemica inflation, whether it be from player adoption spikes, planned Alchemical events like The Great Battles, or very lucky surveyed REALM Parcels.

## レルム トークノミクス

### 総供給量

The total supply of REALM is 420,069. Initially, 155,069 REALM will be unlocked and distributed over a period of two years (Act 1). They make up the Citaadel and the Grid. The remaining REALM are currently obscured in an area known as The Beyond. As certain game milestones are reached, these REALM will be unlocked to offer new game experiences (Acts 2-3).

### 配布方法

REALM Parcels will be distributed in two main ways:

Method 1: Incentivized GBM Auctions (80%)

The primary distribution method for REALM Parcels will be the incentivized GBM auction system. Participants will be able to select and bid on specific parcels from within the Gotchiverse world map. In a GBM auction, a participant can earn GHST by participating, even if they do not win the NFT. 2019年にCryptographsによって最初に開拓されたGBMオークションは、特許出願中のシステムです。 そしてPixelcraft Studios（ピクんセルクラフトスタジオ）は召喚第２, ランドセールさらにはアイテムやウエラブルを含むすべてのAavegotchi NFTのためにそれを使用する正式なライセンスとされています

Check out our [Aauction page](/aauction) for more information.

This revolutionary auction model solves many problems inherent to the popular First Come First Serve (FCFS) drops, but they naturally, still favor those with the most capital to invest.

To balance this, the team has decided to raffle off the remaining 20% of REALM parcels using Chainlink VRF-powered Raffles.

Method 2: Raffle (20%)

The secondary distribution method for REALM Parcels will be Chainlink VRF-powered Raffles. Participants will enter via Drop Tickets that are used for Portal and REALM Raffles. Drop Tickets can be earned by holding summoned Aavegotchis, participating in Missions, or by converting FRENS points or other [Raffle tickets](/staking#purchasing-raffle-tickets) at a rate of 10,000 FRENS points per Drop Ticket. Begin accruing FRENS points now by [staking GHST](/staking).

### ドロップチケット

Drop Tickets are ERC-1155 NFTs that are fully tradable on the Aavegotchi [Baazaar](/baazaar). Each Drop Ticket represents **one** entry into the NFT Raffles, where you can win Aavegotchi Portals and REALM Parcels.

<img class="bodyImage" src="/gotchiverse/drop-tickets-and-realm-parcels.png" alt="Aavegotchi Drop Tickets and REALM Parcels" />

There are three ways to get Drop Tickets:

* Convert 10,000 FRENS into one Drop Ticket
* Convert other Raffle Tickets into a Drop Ticket
* Refer your friends to earn Drop Tickets 🔥

### 区画ブースト

Some REALM parcels come with Parcel Boosts. Parcel Boosts are spots of Alchemica directly adjacent to REALM Parcels within the Gotchiverse. Unlike surveyed Alchemica, which is randomly given by Chainlink VRF, Parcel Boosts are base amounts of Alchemica that are added to the total Alchemica of a Parcel after surveying.

Alchemica Boost amounts are 1000, 500, 250, and 100 for FUD, FOMO, ALPHA, and KEK respectively.

table_alchemicalBoostsAndAmountPerLocation

**Replenishings**

After each Great Battle in Act 1, players will be able to survey their Parcel again, rolling to get more Alchemica. The Boost amount above will be added onto the amount rolled by the player for each surveying round.

**Alchemica Bubble Ups**

The Bubble Ups concept grew out of the debated Paatch 0.1c where Increase Boost Amounts failed to pass. Alchemica Bubble Ups provide additional utility to boosts, while still requiring the player to actively harvest the Alchemica that bubbles up.

Alchemica Bubble Ups are sporadic (but not infrequent) events where Alchemica pickups appear on top of deposits of Alchemica in the Gotchiverse, especially near active parcels. Notably, it is **Pixelcraft’s Gameplay vested release allocation** that will support these Alchemical releases, although AavegotchiDAO can also vote to supplement the amount.
