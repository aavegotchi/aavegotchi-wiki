### Tap increase for Scaling Sprint

**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #1**

**Proposal Summary:** The GHST Bonding Curve has been live for nearly one month and with that comes the first opportunity for GHST holders to adjust the DAICO’s tap mechanism. AavegotchiDAO 1.0 is built on the Aragon platform and functions as a straightforward DAICO where GHST holders are able to vote once per month to increase or decrease the flow of funds to the core team via the tap. The tap provides DAI directly from the GHST Bonding Curve where over 7.5 million DAI are currently secured.

We request the Aavegotchi community vote to increase the tap from 50K DAI / 30 days to 100K DAI / 30 days. 50k DAI was not enough to cover all of the milestones achieved (community growth, GHST token, game development) and the next sprint is even more ambitious. The hard coded constraints of AavegotchiDAO 1.0 limit this proposal to only a 50K DAI increase for this month’s voting period and thus we have budgeted our strategy with a total 100k DAI tap in mind.

The budget going forward deploys the additional 50k DAI into 4 distinct categories:

- A game maker’s fund so we can solidify terms with key game developers.
- Additional contracts for key positions in marketing, design, and development.
- A marketing boost to make sure Aavegotchi’s presence is expanded.
- Community rewards so we can continue to develop programs (like the Aartists and Aapprentices teams) that incentivize the most inspired in our community.

**Voting Period:** 15 - 19 October 2020

**Results:**
