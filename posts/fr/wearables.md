Wearables are an important component of the Aavegotchi game. Besides endowing your Aavegotchi with a sense of fashion, wearables also boost the Aavegotchi's traits and rarity score, enabling them to perform better in [mini-games](/minigames), [rarity farming](/rarity-farming), and in the [Aarena](/aarena#wearable-boosts).

Wearables conform to the ERC-1155 standard.

This page contains detailed information about every wearable that has been confirmed in the Aavegotchi game.

Design of the wearables are done by [Xibot](/team#xibot), our team of [community aartists](/aartist), and the [Forge](/forge) team. Each wearable comes with 4 different views (front, right, left, and back).

For information on **Wearable Sets**, check out this [page](/sets)!

*Note: There are some objects (IDs 162-198, 210) that are not reflected on this page as they are not wearables. These objects are [Baadges](/baadge) and the Haunt 1 Background.*

## Key

Aavegotchis have four traits that can be modified by wearables.

* AGG = Aggressiveness
* NRG = Energy
* SPK = Spookiness
* BRN = Brain Size

The traits of "Eye Color" and "Eye Shape" cannot be modified by wearables.

*Note: Negative values do not mean the trait is getting "weaker". Aavegotchi traits are distributed on a bell curve, so the extremes (0,1) and (99,100) are actually the best!*

See [Traits](/traits) for more about this topic.

## Wearables [Basic Rarity Score (BRS)](/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score)

Wearables can be equipped or unequipped at any time. Equipping/unequipping wearables may affect the [overall rarity](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score) of an Aavegotchi:

## Voting Power

With the passing of [AGIP 9](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#voting-power-based-on-wearables--maall-price), wearables now have voting power in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao). The voting power (measured in GHST) of a given wearable is based on its Rarity Type/[Maall](/maall) price.

## Weapons

Certain Wearables have also been selected to be used as [Weapons](/weapons) with the Gotchiverse.

Weapons are hand wearables classified either as Melee or Ranged Weapon. These special Wearables can inflict damage upon Gotchis (in the Aarena), Lickquidators, Enemies, and Waalls.

Each Weapon will also be endowed with special benefits, such as extra damage to Waalls, extra damage to Lickquidators, extra attack speed, and others.

## LINK Themed Set

Distributed via an exclusive, limited-edition Raffle in November 2020, these LINK-themed wearables celebrate Aavegotchi's partnership with Chainlink, specifically our use of Chainlink VRF to ensure that Aavegotchis have verifiable, provably random traits.

## Santa Wearables Set

One of our friends accidentally sent 4000 LINK (~$50,000) to the GHST Staking Contract. We raised funds from our community to help him out. Everyone who donated more than $20 worth of ANY ERC20 token to SantaGotchi.eth will be airdropped a limited edition Santagotchi Hat. See [here](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1339738554906243072) for more information. Picture for the wearable will be out soon! Other items in the Santa wearables set will be available soon as well.

## OKex Wearables

On 7 October 2020, Aavegotchi partnered with OKex to create a special set of wearables inspired by Jay Hao, the CEO of OKex. Lucky depositors who deposit their GHST tokens on the OKex platform stood a chance to win these wearables. 150 wearables are available. The top 5 depositors will automatically win the full 5 piece set. But the remaining 125 NFTs will be randomly awarded to anyone who deposits more than 10 GHST.
