**Alchemica Supply Allocation**

table_totalSupplyAllocation

**Channeling (25%)**

The budget for Alchemical and Communal Channeling, to be distributed throughout the lifetime of the Gotchiverse is **25% of the total supply for each token.** To prevent excessive inflation, new Alchemica are only minted when the balance of the Great Portal is less than its capacity (see Crafting Revenue Distribution section below).

Initial amounts of Alchemical Channeling will be discussed in the Alchemical Channeling section of Chapter 3.

**Ecosystem (10%)**

Managed by [AavegotchiDAO](/dao), 10% of the total supply of Alchemica are set aside for an assortment of onboarding and liquidity activities outside of the Gotchiverse. These tokens will be minted then released via a vesting contract over a **thirty year period**, giving predictability and transparency to the usage of Alchemica within the Gotchiverse ecosystem for years to come.

**Gameplay (15%)**

Managed by Pixelcraft Studios and the REALM smart contract, these 15% of the total supply of Alchemica represent the budget for Alchemica to be distributed in-game over the lifetime of the Gotchiverse.

Of the 15% total allocation, 33.3% (or 5% of total supply) will be allocated via the smart contract “Boost” system for adjacent alchemica. **These tokens are not vested, but can only be minted via Gotchiverse gameplay.**

The remaining 66.6% (or 10% of total supply) will be **vested via the same schedule as the Ecosystem allocation above**, and used primarily for Alchemical Bubble Ups, Dungeons, and other in-game rewards that are not distributed via smart contract.

**Parcel Allocations (50%)**

50% of all Alchemica have been earmarked for Parcels in the Gotchiverse, including all three Acts and replenishings in each Act.

Act 1 will distribute roughly 25% of the total supply, whereas Act 2 and Act 3 will distribute 15% and 10%, respectively.
