**THE AAVEGOTCHI MISSION PROGRAM IS NOW COMPLETE!**

Closing an epic chapter in Aavegotchi history, around 280 of our dedicated community members have made their way up through the ranks to official Aavegotchi Aagent status! These agents will be the exclusive owners of the [Aavegotchi Aagent wearable set](/wearables#aagent-wearables-set), cementing their place in Aavegotchi lore.

**CONGRATULATIONS AAGENTS!** <img src="/missions/tinyagent.png" alt = "aavegotchi agent" />


From the aarchives:

<p style="font-size:25px; font-style: italic;"><b>"Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."</b></p>

Aavegotchi “missions” are a fun way to get a great understanding of the Aavegotchi project. Most are simple tasks (with the exception of just one that requires a bit more thought) and can be done whenever time permits and in any order you choose. As you complete each one, you’ll be leveled up by our Aaprentices, until you reach full Aagent status! Just be sure to hop in to Mission Control before mainnet launch, as our Aagent program will only run until then. Upon mainnet launch, Aagents who have **completed ALL Aavegotchi missions** will receive a **complete Aagent wearable set exclusively for Aavegotchi Aagents.**

**ALL 12 MISSIONS MUST BE COMPLETED BY 4 JANUARY 2021!**

[**MISSION 6:**](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-8-8e2bcba353b9) Use our testnet to buy testnet (not real) GHST from the testnet bonding curve (which does NOT require KYC - the real bonding curve does, but **you can complete all missions without KYC).** This is where you’ll suddenly become an expert on using testnets if you haven’t before, and will feel super smart helping everyone who comes after you.
