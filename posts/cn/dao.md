[DAO](glossary#dao) 是一种去中心化的治理形式，它允许代币持有者投票，以促进组织决策的方式。

Aavegotchi效仿Compound和Synthetix等成功的DeFi协议，遵循 "逐步去中心化 "的过程，从创始团队Pixelcraft Studios组织DAO治理的代币发行活动（DAICO）开始，最终将Aavegotchi的治理，包括所有的游戏机制、智能合约和资金，置于AavegotchiDAO的管辖下，但必须遵循现行法规环境。 这将分三个阶段完成。

## 创世纪

*查看* [DAICO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/curve/#aavegotchi-daico).

AavegotchiDAO的第一次迭代与GHST代币分配活动同步推出。 GHST代币持有者有权投票决定增加/维持， [联合曲线 bonding curve (TBC)](/curve) 中给Pixelcraft工作室（Aavegotchi背后的团队）预留支持开发的资金。 将资金水龙头从每月5万DAI提高到10万DAI的首个提议，在2020年10月18日以99%的支持率通过。 当我们打算过渡到AavegotchiDAO Metamorphosis（蜕变）的时候，代币持有者也会投票决定是否进行迁移。

代币持有者不会因为积极参与此次AavegotchiDAO的迭代而获得GHST的奖励。

Features for Genesis include:

* No smart contract calls
* No contract upgrades
* GHST token based governance
* Platform: Aragon
* Rewards: None
* Layer: Ethereum Mainnet

## Cocoon

V1.5 of AavegotchiDAO. The intermediate point between [Genesis](/dao#genesis) and [Metamorphosis](/dao#metamorphosis). The priority for the Cocoon stage is to influence game mechanics.

Its features include:

* Contract calls called by Pixelcraft
* No contract upgrades
* GHST token based governance
* Platform: Snapshot/Discourse
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) for Core Votes
* Layer: Polygon

There are 2 types of voting in the Cocoon stage: (1) Signal Proposal, and (2) Core Proposal.

A Signal Proposal can be posted by anyone to the Community tab on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/aavegotchi.eth). These votes are non-binding, but if quorum is achieved, the proposal will automatically be upgraded into a binding Core Proposal. Before you come up with a Signal Proposal, it is mandatory to discuss it with the community on Discord and/or [Discourse/AavegotchiDAO Forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/). The rationale is to ideate further and to discover whether there is worthy support to move forward with the Signal Proposal. Please follow the template found in the [Creating Signal Proposals section](/dao#creating-signal-proposals).

The Signal Proposal will be upgraded to a Core Proposal once the former passes with a quorum reaching 20% of circulating GHST eligible to vote on Polygon at the time of proposal creation.

A Core Proposal is a proposal that Pixelcraft puts forward, with options based on Signal Proposals that reached or nearly reached quorum. These votes are binding and are eligible for XP rewards to participants.

If your Signal Proposal is successfully upgraded to a Core Proposal, 150 [XP](/traits#experience)* will be given to the Aavegotchi you have noted in your Signal Proposal.

*May increase or decrease throughout COCOON period

## Metamorphosis

Metamorphosis is the second iteration of AavegotchiDAO, and is charged with managing simple game mechanics of Aavegotchi, such as the total supply of Aavegotchis, adding new collaterals, deciding on their functions, and adding new wearables created by the community. When the time comes to migrate to AavegotchiDAO Oasis, the AavegotchiDAO will again vote to perform the migration.

A full list of actions available to perform by the AavegotchiDAO in this phase is available in the [Governance](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/governance) section of the Aavegotchi smart contract documentation.

Token holders will receive rewards in the form of GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.

Its features include:

* Can execute smart contract calls
* Can upgrade certain mechanics
* Aavegotchi + GHST governance
* Platform: Custom dapp front-end
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) + badges for voting
* Layer: Polygon

## Oasis

Although AavegotchiDAO Oasis is the final iteration of AavegotchiDAO’s evolution, it is only the beginning of the realization of a DAO-governed game. All decisions related to Aavegotchi game mechanics, REALM mechanics, ecosystem spending, and even smart contract upgrades will be voted on by the AavegotchiDAO.

Token holders will receive rewards in GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.

Its features include:

* Can execute smart contract calls
* Can upgrade certain mechanics
* Aavegotchi + GHST governance
* Platform: Aavegotchi Realm
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) + badges for voting
* Layer: Polygon

## Participating in Governance
I'm psyched up! So how do I participate in the AavegotchiDAO? Fren, we got you covered!

First, you can participate in the discussions in the [AavegotchiDAO forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/). We welcome everyone!

Second, the [Aavegotchi Docs](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/governance) details the list of DAO functions that members can call/use in order to implement changes that have been voted in. For example, let's say that asUSD has been voted in as a [collateral type](/posts/atokens). AavegotchiDAO could implement the change by using the `addCollateralTypes()` function and specifying asUSD within the function.

More details will be fleshed out once the game releases!

## AavegotchiDAO Forum

The AavegotchiDAO Governance Forum is powered by Discourse. Having this forum will help centralize discussion on important topics related to Aavegotchi game mechanics, funding requests, and other proposals.

We hope that #GotchiGang can become a model for DAO-owned games in the future, so get involved and remember to be frenly to your fellows.

The Forum can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/).

## Creating Signal Proposals

To create signal proposals for the #GotchiGang to vote on, please adhere to the following format:

* Author + GotchiID
* Link to the matching Discourse thread (Proposals without significant discussion in the forum will be automatically removed from Snapshot)
* Summary (include rationale, timeline, goals and any key performance indicators) Copy/paste proposals of existing proposals will be removed while proposals with similar but distinct variations are permitted to exist side by side.
* Effect
* Highlight end goal and benefits
* Acknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences
* Any alternative paths (Plan B, Plan C, etc)
* The end time of a proposal should not be longer than 30 days from its starting time, to ensure that only active proposals are displayed on Snapshot Community board.

More details can be found in this [Medium post](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/scaling-aavegotchidao-c7e589de0333).

## Voting

There are two ways to vote: (1) Snapshot Voting, and/or (2) Aragon Voting.


### 快照投票

Snapshot is a voting DApp on Ethereum. Votes made on Snapshot does not require any gas and are not on-chain. Aavegotchi's Snapshot page can be found [here](https://snapshot.page/#/aavegotchi.eth).

To vote on Snapshot, follow the steps below:

1). Go to an open proposal.

2). Connect your wallet.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot1.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />
<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot2.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />

3). Select a poll option, and click "Vote." A pop-up will appear to confirm your choice.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot3.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />
<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot4.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />

4). Your Metamask will pop up. Sign the transaction, and you're done!

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot5.jpg" alt = "sign transaction on Snapshot Voting" />

### Aragon投票

Aragon is a tool for creating and participating in decentralized organizations on Ethereum. Votes made on Aragon requires gas and exists on-chain.

Aavegotchi's Aragon page can be found [here](https://client.aragon.org/#/aavegotchi/0xf63e1edbcb3be8d5fb124f4a228f5412f48e5ae7/).

To vote on Aragon, follow the steps below:

1). Go to an open proposal.

2). Connect your wallet.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/aragon1.jpg" alt = "Aragon Voting Ethereum" />

3). Choose to vote "Yes" or "No."

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/aragon2.jpg" alt = "Aragon Voting Ethereum" />

4). A Metamask transaction will pop-up. Take note that your transaction has to be mined to be confirmed, so consult a site like [gasnow](https://gasnow.org/) for the latest gas price.

5). Once your transaction is mined, your vote will be reflected accordingly.

## Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals (AGIPs)

See those votes on Aragon? They are Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals (AGIPs)!

Visit the [Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals) page for a list of historical votes. If you'd like to be informed of future proposals, follow [Aavegotchi on social media](/socialmedia).

## Treasury

AavegotchiDAO earns 0.3% of all trades on the Aavegotchi [Bonding Curve](/curve) on Ethereum Mainnet. This is the current source of all DAO funds.

As responsible stewards, members of AavegotchiDAO will play a role in determining how these funds are to be allocated.

The AavegotchiDAO treasury is located [here](https://aavegotchi.com/treasury).
