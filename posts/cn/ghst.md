The GHST token is the eco-governance token that powers the whole Aavegotchi ecosystem.

Holding GHST grants the owner voting power in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) at a rate of 1 vote per token. GHST is also the main currency of account for trading NFTs in the [Aavegotchi marketplace](/marketplace).

GHST is live on Base. Aavegotchi has migrated to Base.

GHST is a fully compliant ERC20 token. You can view its contract address on Polygon here: [https://polygonscan.com/token/0x385eeac5cb85a38a9a07a70c73e0a3271cfb54a7](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x385eeac5cb85a38a9a07a70c73e0a3271cfb54a7)

## 为什么要GHST？


用户激励在任何项目中都发挥着巨大的作用。 在这种情况下，GHST提供了经济激励，以鼓励更多的人参与Aavegotchi生态系统。 具体来说，该代币有助于平衡AavegotchiDAO、GHST持有者和Aavegotchi持有者各自的角色。

Players have to buy GHST and spend it within the ecosystem. 其中一部分会直接转回DAO，继续资助生态系统的发展。 At the same time, part of the value is also distributed as rewards for wise governance in the DAO, and as rewards for engaging in [rarity farming](/rarity-farming).

For more information, make sure to check out the [Tokenomics page](/tokenomics).

## Total supply

GHST was initially launched using a “bonding curve” mechanism where GHST was backed by DAI. However, in 2023, the AavegotchiDAO [voted to remove the bonding curve](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals-2023#close-the-ghst-bonding-curve) and make GHST a free-floating token.

Following the removal of the bonding curve, the total supply of GHST token is now fixed at 52,747,802 GHST.

As GHST will still be burnt through various mechanisms in the Aavegotchi ecosystem, please refer to the contract on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/{{GHST_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS}}) for a real-time update of the token's total supply.

## Is GHST decentralized?

Yes, GHST is a fully decentralized token, with no admin privileges or backdoors. Originally deployed under the ownership of AavegotchiDAO, when the bonding curve turned off, the DAO that maintained admin keys to GHST was also dismantled, meaning that no one owns the admin keys to GHST any longer.
