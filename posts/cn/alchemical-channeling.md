Alchemical Channeling (occasionally referred to as a “Gotchi UBI”) is a basic daily stipend earned by Aavegotchis that comes directly from the Gotchiverse ether, instead of being harvested from the parcel.

## How to channel Alchemica

Aavegotchis can participate in Alchemical Channeling by walking up to an Alchemical Aaltar on a REALM parcel owned by their owner (or for borrowed gotchis, by the original owner) and clicking the “Channel Alchemica” action button. This will initiate an onchain transaction that transfers a portion of Alchemica directly to the Gotchi owner (or into the Gotchi Pocket, for borrowed Gotchis), while another portion will spillover on the nearby map.

**Note that channeled Alchemica is not taken from the REALM Parcel’s surveyed amount!**

## How much Alchemica will I receive

Exactly how much Alchemica (FUD, FOMO, ALPHA, and KEK) the Gotchi receives through Alchemical Channeling depends primarily on its [Kinship](/kinship) level.

The base rate for channeling is 20 FUD, 10 FOMO, 5 ALPHA, and 2 KEK. This base rate then gets multiplied by a modifier, depending on the Aavegotchi’s kinship level (see table below).

Each point of Kinship increases the Alchemical Channeling modifier, by the formula:

Every Aavegotchi is eligible to engage in Alchemical Channeling **once every 24 hours.**

The final amount is then divided into two portions – the amount the Gotchi (or its owner) receives directly, and the amount that spills nearby.

Higher level Alchemical Aaltars reduce the [spillover rate](/glossary#spillover-rate) by 5% per level.

## Limits on Alchemical Channeling

Every Aavegotchi is eligible to engage in Alchemical Channeling once every 24 hours.

However, Alchemical Channeling does take a toll on the Alchemical Aaltar, which means it needs to recharge between channelings. Higher level Aaltars have more Spirit energy, which allows them to engage in Alchemical Channeling with a shorter cooldown:
