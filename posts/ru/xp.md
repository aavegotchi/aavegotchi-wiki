## Gaining XP
Aavegotchis receive experience (XP) for:
* Voting in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao)
* Participating in events held on Aavegotchi Discord (a Typeform will be released during the event for people to complete to receive XP for their Gotchis)
* Playing [mini-games](/minigames) (only during certain periods as announced on Discord)

## ФОРМУЛА
The following formula is used to determine the XP required for the next level:

(Current Level ^ 2) ÷ Constant, where Constant = 0.02

## Experience Table

The table below shows the XP required for each level. Before delving into the data, here are some helpful definitions of the key terms used:

* Current Level: Current Level of your Gotchi
* Next Level: Next Level of your Gotchi
* XP: Experience required to reach the next level that is specified in the **Next Level** column
* Difference: Difference in the XP required to reach the level in the **Next Level** column compared to the same column in the previous row
* Constant: A fixed value that is used in the computation of the XP required for the next level Formula

The maximum level that an aavegotchi could attain is 99. Any changes to the maximum level could be done through [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) proposals.

*Note: Aavegotchis start at Level 1. "Level 0" is included in the table for individuals who are interested to apply the formula and observe how XP computation works.*

## Tracking XP received

Our frenly [aarchitect](/aarchitect) Frank Pfeift has created an application to track the XP that a Gotchi has received over its lifetime.

His app can be accessed [here](https://aavegotchi-xp-dashboard.vercel.app). Your Gotchi ID is the digits that are found at the end of the URL at your [Gotchi Profile Page](/aavegotchi-profile).

## XP Requirements for joining Guilds

Gotchis are social creatures who love to hang with their frens, but much like starry-eyed college freshmen trying to attend every campus club activity, they get burned out with too much social activity.

As they gain more experience and become more worldly, their work-life balance improves, allowing them to take on more [Guild](/guild) responsibilities.

Thus, how many Guilds a Gotchi can join depends on its XP Level.
