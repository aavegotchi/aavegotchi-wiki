Weapons are hand wearables classified either as Melee or Ranged Weapon. These special Wearables can inflict damage upon Gotchis (in the [Aarena](/aarena)), Lickquidators, Enemies, and Waalls.

Each Weapon will also be endowed with special benefits, such as extra damage to Waalls, extra damage to Lickquidators, extra attack speed, and others.
