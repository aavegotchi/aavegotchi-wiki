Gotchichain will be the dedicated blockchain for all things Aavegotchi. Lower fees and faster confirmation times will make it the ultimate user experience for blockchain gamers, and the perfect building ground for developers and game studios.

Gotchichain is designed to power the Aavegotchi Gaming Console, keeping everything — player profiles, game progression, and assets—safe on the chain.

## Settlement Layer

Gotchichain will use [Base](https://www.base.org/) as its settlement layer. Base is a leading EVM-compatible Layer 2 (L2) chain developed by Coinbase that offers a safe, low-cost, and developer-friendly way to develop onchain, while still remaining strongly aligned with Ethereum.

Pixelcraft studios is leveraging this partnership with Base to explore the option of using the Optimism stack to enhance Gotchichain further. The Optimism Stack, a gift to the open-source community, lays the groundwork for a "superchain" of L2s, offering shared interoperability, sequencing, and governance, creating a united ecosystem of scalability solutions.

## Gas Token

On Gotchichain, [GHST](/ghst) (Aavegotchi’s eco-governance token) will be the gas token for all transactions.

## Launch Date

Gotchichain is expected to drop in Q2 2024.
