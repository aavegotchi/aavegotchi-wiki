"Psst.....you there"

The Merchant Gotchi surreptitiously beckons you over to his stall, with a glint in his eye.

"I have something aamazing for you."

The Merchant Gotchi brings out a cloth-covered object. Slowly, he pulls away the cloth. The object catches the sun's rays and shines in the bright afternoon sun.

".....A Mudgen Diamond" you whisper to yourself.

The marvellous shine catches the attention of countless bystanders.

Another Gotchi shoves in. "I'll have it!"

"NO! I'LL HAVE IT!"

This, my Frens, is the Aavegotchi Baazaar. Are you savvy enough to spot and snap up a good deal fast? Can you stand the heat of haggling your way to riches?

Come and test your mettle! Buyers and sellers alike!

## Aavegotchi Baazaar

The Aavegotchi Baazaar is the official secondary marketplace for Aavegotchi. Sellers can list their items for sale. There will be a listing fee of 0.1 GHST for every new listing on the Aavegotchi Baazaar. This is to prevent spam listings on Polygon. This 0.1 GHST goes neither to Pixelcraft Studios nor to AavegotchiDAO. Instead, it will be sent directly to the [burn address](https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF/tokens) on Polygon when a listing is created or updated.

## Collection Addresses

The following table displays the official smart contract addresses for the various Aavegotchi assets. Before making any purchase on any marketplace, do verify the contract of the asset you are purchasing against the relevant contract in the table below (e.g. if you are intending to purchase a Raffle Ticket, check against the Raffle Tickets contract address before proceeding).

## Precautions

It's not fun to spend your hard-earned money for fake assets, so when buying on Opensea and other secondary marketplaces, make sure to exercise caution. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!

* Always double-check that the contract address for the items are coming from the correct contract addresses.
* If you're unsure about something, go to the [official Aavegotchi Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6), where there's always frenly Aapprentices ready to help!
