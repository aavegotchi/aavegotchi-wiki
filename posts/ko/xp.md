Aavegotchis level up as they gain more Experience (XP). But exactly how much XP do they need at each level? Data analysts, we have some numbers for you to crunch here!

## Formula
The following formula is used to determine the XP required for the next level:

(Current Level ^ 2) ÷ Constant, where Constant = 0.02

## Experience Table

The table below shows the XP required for each level. Before delving into the data, here are some helpful definitions of the key terms used:

* Current Level: Current Level of your Gotchi
* Next Level: Next Level of your Gotchi
* XP: Experience required to reach the next level that is specified in the **Next Level** column
* Difference: Difference in the XP required to reach the level in the **Next Level** column compared to the same column in the previous row
* Constant: A fixed value that is used in the computation of the XP required for the next level Formula

The maximum level that an aavegotchi could attain is 99. Any changes to the maximum level could be done through [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) proposals.

*Note: Aavegotchis start at Level 1. "Level 0" is included in the table for individuals who are interested to apply the formula and observe how XP computation works.*
