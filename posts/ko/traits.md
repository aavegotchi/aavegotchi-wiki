Aavegotchis are born with traits. Just like how your traits define who you are as a person, an Aavegotchi's traits are important in determining their livelihood as a ghost too! These multiple traits that they possess influence their [Trait Base Rarity](/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score), their performance in mini-games, and the [wearables](/wearables) that they are allowed to wear. Aavegotchis summoned from [portals](/portals) are born with a combination of randomly-generated traits. However, the Aavegotchi’s traits can change with <a href=#level>level</a>, equipped wearables and consumables used.

## Randomly Generated Traits
Aavegotchis have six traits:

* AGG = Aggressiveness
* NRG = Energy
* SPK = Spookiness
* BRN = Brain Size
* EYS = Eye Shape
* EYC = Eye Color

Using RPG (Role-playing Game) terminology, `AGG` is equivalent to Strength, `NRG` is equivalent to Agility, `BRN` is equivalent to Intelligence, and `SPK` is a wildcard trait. Do note that these traits are not exactly the same as standard RPGs; lower trait values in the Aavegotchi metaverse are also very powerful!

Traits are determined at the point of opening a [Portal](/portals). Upon opening of a Portal, [Chainlink’s VRF random number generator function](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/) is called to assign Aavegotchis with random trait values. These trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Mythical, depending on its rarity. The chances of getting each trait rarity is shown in the table below:

The bell curve for trait value distribution would look something like the following:

Aavegotchis possess six traits initially, although these may be extended in the future via voting in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao). Some traits, like the Aavegotchi's body colour (other than plain old white), will be defined by the AavegotchiDAO for every new haunt!

Unlike other games, in Aavegotchi, there is no “optimal” trait. Each attribute (except for eye shape and eye color) has different effects in different mini-games. For example, Aavegotchis with higher energy may perform well in races, but would not perform well in a meditation mini-game.

The tables below detail each trait by rarity. *Note: The two tables should be seen as one. It has been split apart to render on mobile devices.*

<p style="margin-left: 3.0em"><i> *Common eye colours take on the colours of the staked collateral on your Aavegotchi. i.e. orange for aDAI, sky blue for aAAVE, purple for aETH etc. </i></p>

## Kinship
Kinship is your Aavegotchi’s feeling of loyalty towards you. Kinship is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value (50) upon summon and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it. The minimum kinship value is 0. There is no maximum kinship value.

Typically, longer ownership equals higher kinship, but neglecting your Aavegotchi for long periods of time will lower its kinship level. Aavegotchis aren’t just vessels to store your crypto bags. They’re living, breathing ghosts, and they need your affection!

A maximum of 1 Kinship point is accrued for every 12 hour period in which you interact with your Aavegotchi. Conversely, there will be a -1 Kinship point penalty if your Aavegotchi is left unengaged for 24 hours.

Potions could also be used to improve kinship scores. However, they are limited edition consumables and may not always be available in the Aavegotchi store. More details on potions will be available soon.

High kinship levels can boost your Aavegotchi’s performance in mini-games, and may also act as a multiplier for GHST rewards on governance and [rarity farming](/rarity-farming). Low kinship levels will have the opposite effect.

Some ways to boost your Aavegotchi’s kinship level:

* Aavegotchis are born with a sense of civic duty. Bring your Aavegotchi to City Hall and let it vote in AavegotchiDAO;
* Aavegotchis may be ghosts, but they have voracious appetites! Feed your Aavegotchi consumables to see its spooky smile;
* Aavegotchis love trying on new clothes. Equip your Aavegotchi with new wearables to forge a lasting bond;
* Aavegotchis love to play! Take your Aavegotchi out for a romp in the Aavegotchi Realm and level it up playing mini-games.


## Experience
Aavegotchis receive experience (XP) for voting in AavegotchiDAO and playing mini-games. Aavegotchis can also be sacrificed to remove their [collateral stake](/atokens) and have it transferred to another Aavegotchi. The recipient Aavegotchi will receive 100% of the sacrificed Aavegotchi’s accrued XP.

## Level
Aavegotchis level up as they gain more XP. Every three levels, Aavegotchis receive one [Spirit Point](/glossary#spirit-point) that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait. Some wearables can only be worn by Aavegotchis of a certain level.

For detailed information on the XP required for each level, click [here](/xp).

## Haunt
Like pioneers to the New World, Aavegotchis travel from the Nether Realm to the Ether Realm in groups known as Haunts. The initial Haunt contains 10,000 Aavegotchis. Thereafter, new Haunts must be approved for travel by the AavegotchiDAO. Some wearables can only be worn by Aavegotchis belonging to a certain Haunt.
