Wearables are an important component of the Aavegotchi game. Besides endowing your Aavegotchi with a sense of fashion, wearables also boost the Aavegotchi's traits and rarity score, enabling them to perform better in [minigames](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/minigames), as well as in [rarity farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/rarity-farming).

This page contains detailed information about every wearable that has been confirmed in the Aavegotchi game.

## Key

Aavegotchis have four traits that can be modified by wearables.

* AGG = Aggressiveness
* NRG = Energy
* SPK = Spookiness
* BRN = Brain Size

The traits of "Eye Color" and "Eye Shape" cannot be modified by wearables.

*Note: Negative values do not mean the trait is getting "weaker". Aavegotchi traits are distributed on a bell curve, so the extremes (0,1) and (99,100) are actually the best!*

See [Traits](/traits) for more about this topic.

## Wearables [Basic Rarity Score (BRS)](/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score)

Wearables can be equipped or unequipped at any time. Equipping/unequipping wearables may affect the [overall rarity](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score) of an Aavegotchi:

## Santa Wearables Set

One of our friends accidentally send 4000 LINK (~$50,000) to the GHST Staking Contract. We raised funds from our community to help him out.

## OKex Wearables

On 7 October 2020, Aavegotchi partnered with OKex to create a special set of wearables inspired by Jay Hao, the CEO of OKex. Lucky depositors who deposit their GHST tokens on the OKex platform stood a chance to win these wearables. 150 wearables are available. The top 5 depositors will automatically win the full 5 piece set. But the remaining 125 NFTs will be randomly awarded to anyone who deposits more than 10 GHST.
