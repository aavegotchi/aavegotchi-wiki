## Haunt 1



Haunt 1 was launched on 2 March 2021. 10,000 Aavegotchi [Portals](/portals) were released to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis.

The first 10,000 portals were sold out in less than one minute. The launch was a huge success by all metrics except the fact that not everyone could have a Portal.

Haunt 1 Aavegotchis also come with an exclusive Haunt 1 Background. Check out this [medium post](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-nft-backgrounds-are-live-and-ready-to-be-equipped-92c8b5bb92a8) on how to claim it if you have a Haunt 1 Gotchi. The background is programmed to be non-transferable. This means from now till forever, only Haunt 1 Aavegotchis can equip this beautiful portal-themed background!

This exclusive background was voted for in [AGIP-5](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#give-unique-non-transferable-background-to-haunt-1-aavegotchis).

## Haunt 2

Haunt 2 consists of 15,000 Portals, with 12,000 (80%) being [auctioned off](/aauction) and the remaining 3,000 (20%) being [raffled off](/tickets) using Drop Tickets.

Unlike Haunt 1 which featured a “blinkandyoumissit” first-come, first serve drop, Haunt 2 promises much more sustained excitement, with a three-day #BidToEarn auction, followed by a Raffle for our loyal GHST stakers.

The Haunt 2 Auction runs from 26 - 29 August 2021.

The Haunt 2 Raffle will be held from 5 - 8 September 2021.

## Exclusive Spirit Forces
Each Haunt has some Spirit Forces that are exclusive to it:
