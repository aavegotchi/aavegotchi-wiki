Note: FRENS has been sunset. Stake liquidity to earn GLTR instead via the GLTR staking page. If you are on Base, use aavegotchi.com as the entry point if the app pages display a "not functional on Base" notice.

스테이킹이란 보상을 대가로 여러분의 암호화폐를 락업하는 과정을 의미합니다. 이는 아베고치에서도 결코 다르지 않습니다. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in various staking contracts to earn [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) rewards.

## GLTR


The primary utility of [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) is allowing players in the Gotchiverse to speed up the crafting and upgrading of their [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels) by burning GLTR, allowing them to reach higher levels of the game faster. Every burned GLTR is equivalent to one block on the Polygon PoS network.

GLTR also has a secondary utility, being the main token required for [Wearable Crest](/guild#accessing-a-guild) auctions. Guilds will also have the choice to burn GLTR to speed up the time for their next Guild Channeling.
