스테이킹이란 보상을 대가로 여러분의 암호화폐를 락업하는 과정을 의미합니다. 이는 아베고치에서도 결코 다르지 않습니다. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in various staking contracts to earn [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) rewards.

## GLTR

The primary utility of [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) is allowing players in the Gotchiverse to speed up the crafting and upgrading of their [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels) by burning GLTR, allowing them to reach higher levels of the game faster. Every burned GLTR is equivalent to one block on the Polygon PoS network.

GLTR also has a secondary utility, being the main token required for [Wearable Crest](/guild#accessing-a-guild) auctions. Guilds will also have the choice to burn GLTR to speed up the time for their next Guild Channeling.
