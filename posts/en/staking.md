The end goal of staking is to earn specially themed Aavegotchi wearables.

Here are the steps this is done:

1. Stake either GHST tokens or GHST/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool tokens in the [staking contract](https://aavegotchi.com/stake). Doing this earns you frens points over time.
1. Wait and watch your frens points accumulate.
1. Using your frens points purchase raffle tickets from the [shop](https://aavegotchi.com/shop).
1. Enter your raffle tickets into a [raffle](https://aavegotchi.com/raffle). 
1. When the raffle ends find out what prizes you won and claim them.

You can unstake your GHST and/or GHST/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool tokens at any time.


## Staking & Frens

To stake GHST you must first get GHST.  The easiest way to get GHST is to purchase it from the [ETH/GHST Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH). It can also be purchased from the [GHST bonding curve](https://aavegotchi.com/curve).

Once you have GHST you can stake it directly in the staking contract or you can put it into the [ETH/GHST Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550/ETH) and get pool tokens back that you stake into the staking contract. 

You earn 1 frens point per day for each GHST token staked. You earn 100 frens points per day for each GHST/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool token staked.

*1 GHST earns 1 FRENS point per day, and 1 GHST-ETH LP token earns 100 FRENS / day*

Go to the [staking user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-mainnet) to stake GHST and/or GHST/ETH pool tokens.  This webpage will also show you how many frens points you have accumulated.

Frens points are not transferable. They accumulate for your Ethereum address and you can't transfer them to a different address. You can use them to purchase raffle tickets.

## Purchasing Raffle Tickets

Once you have enough frens go to the [Shop Bulk Buy user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/bulk-buy) to purchase raffle tickets with frens.

There are six different levels of raffle tickets:

## Entering a Raffle and Winning Prizes

A raffle runs for a period of time. During this time you can submit your raffle tickets for chances to win prizes. When the raffle is over you can find out what prizes you won and claim them.

The first raffle started on 10 November 2020 and ran for 3 days. Here were the prizes for the raffle:

![Raffle Prizes](/staking/prizes.png)

Winning prizes depends on which tickets and how many tickets you enter into a raffle, how many prizes there are, and how many tickets other people submit. 

The raffle utilizes Chainlink's [on-chain verifiable randomness](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/) to determine prize winners.

Later on the prizes, also called Wearable Vouchers, can be exchanged for corresponding Aavegotchi wearables from the [shop](https://aavegotchi.com/shop).
