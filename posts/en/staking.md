</div>

Note: FRENS has been sunset. Stake liquidity to earn GLTR instead via the GLTR staking page. If you are on Base, use aavegotchi.com as the entry point if the app pages display a "not functional on Base" notice.

## TL;DR

- **Current (post-FRENS):** Stake eligible liquidity positions to earn **GLTR**.
- **Historical (FRENS era, 2022):** Staking **GHST on Polygon** earned **FRENS** (non-transferable) which could be used for raffle tickets. This is kept here for historical context and old links/citations.

## Historical: FRENS staking (2022)

On **2022-05-28**, the official blog described GHST staking on **Polygon** as earning **FRENS** — a **non-transferable** balance inside the staking contract — and noted that FRENS could be used to buy raffle tickets for raffles (Portals, Wearables, and Gotchiverse REALM rewards at the time).

The post also described (at the time) these staking options to earn FRENS:

- Single-sided **GHST** staking
- LP staking: **GHST-QUICK**, **GHST-USDC**, **GHST-WETH**, **GHST-MATIC**

And it described the baseline earn rate as **“1 FREN per day per GHST staked”**, with higher incentives for LP pools due to impermanent-loss risk (and that reward rates could be adjusted over time).

Staking refers to the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in return for rewards. This is no different in the Aavegotchi project. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in various staking contracts to earn [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) rewards.

## Historical: FRENS-era staking (pre-sunset)

This section captures historical staking mechanics from the period when staking GHST (and certain LP positions) earned **FRENS**.

- **2022-05-28:** Pixelcraft published a staking guide describing FRENS as a non-transferable, non-purchasable balance tracked in the staking contract.
- FRENS could be converted into raffle tickets for Aavegotchi raffles (Portals, Wearables, and Gotchiverse land at the time).
- The guide described five FRENS-earning staking options: **GHST**, **GHST-QUICK**, **GHST-USDC**, **GHST-WETH**, and **GHST-MATIC** (LP options carried impermanent-loss risk).
- The guide described a then-current baseline of **1 FREN per day per GHST** for single-sided staking, and noted that rates could change over time.

## GLTR


The primary utility of [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) is allowing players in the Gotchiverse to speed up the crafting and upgrading of their [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels) by burning GLTR, allowing them to reach higher levels of the game faster. Every burned GLTR is equivalent to one block on the Polygon PoS network.

GLTR also has a secondary utility, being the main token required for [Wearable Crest](/guild#accessing-a-guild) auctions. Guilds will also have the choice to burn GLTR to speed up the time for their next Guild Channeling.
