Note: FRENS has been sunset. Stake liquidity to earn GLTR instead via the GLTR staking page. If you are on Base, use aavegotchi.com as the entry point if the app pages display a "not functional on Base" notice.

Staking refers to the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in return for rewards. This is no different in the Aavegotchi project. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in various staking contracts to earn [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) rewards.

## Historical: GHST staking for FRENS (pre-sunset)

Before GLTR staking became the primary staking incentive, GHST staking rewards were commonly described in terms of **FRENS** (a non-transferable balance inside the staking contract).

Key historical details from an official staking guide published on **2022-05-28**:

- **FRENS** were described as **non-transferable** and **not purchasable**, intended to reward stakers.
- FRENS could be converted into **raffle tickets** for Aavegotchi raffles (see: [Tickets](/tickets)).
- At the time, the guide described five staking options: **GHST**, **GHST-QUICK**, **GHST-USDC**, **GHST-WETH**, and **GHST-MATIC** (LP options carried impermanent-loss risk).
- The guide described **single-sided GHST staking** as a baseline of **1 FREN per day per GHST staked**, and noted that reward rates could be changed over time (historically associated with a FRENS committee / liquidity management).

## GLTR


The primary utility of [GAX Liquidity Token Reward (GLTR)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange#gltr-token) is allowing players in the Gotchiverse to speed up the crafting and upgrading of their [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels) by burning GLTR, allowing them to reach higher levels of the game faster. Every burned GLTR is equivalent to one block on the Polygon PoS network.

GLTR also has a secondary utility, being the main token required for [Wearable Crest](/guild#accessing-a-guild) auctions. Guilds will also have the choice to burn GLTR to speed up the time for their next Guild Channeling.
