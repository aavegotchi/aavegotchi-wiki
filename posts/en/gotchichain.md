## TL;DR

- **2023-04-03:** Pixelcraft announced **Gotchichain** as a planned, dedicated Aavegotchi gaming chain using **Polygon Supernets**.
- The announcement described **GHST** as the planned **gas token** on Gotchichain, with assets minted on Polygon PoS and bridged over for gameplay.
- **Update:** Gotchichain ultimately **did not launch**; Aavegotchi later **migrated to Base**.

## Key facts (from the 2023 announcement)

The official blog post (2023-04-03) described Gotchichain as:

- A **Polygon Supernet** (a permissioned offshoot of Polygon PoS where users can transact, but contract deployment is restricted).
- A chain targeted at **gaming UX** (lower fees, faster confirmations, scalability).
- A chain where **GHST** would be the **gas token** for transactions.
- A setup where **Aavegotchi assets would continue to be minted on Polygon PoS**, but could be **bridged to Gotchichain** to play in the gaming-focused environment.
- A project with a tentative target of **early Q3 2023** for launch.

## What happened later

- **Gotchichain did not launch.**
- Aavegotchi later **migrated to Base** (see: [Base migration](/base-migration)).
