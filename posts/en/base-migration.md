## Base Migration

On **July 25, 2025**, Aavegotchi officially migrated from Polygon to **Base** as its canonical home chain.

### What Changed

* All Aavegotchis, wearables, and game assets now live on **Base**
* Governance (voting, proposals) occurs on **Base**
* Rarity farming rewards are distributed on **Base**
* GHST token canonical address on Base: `0xcD2F22236DD9Dfe2356D7C543161D4d260FD9BcB`
* Polygon contracts are **frozen and view-only**: no transfers, no gameplay

### Why Base?

Infrastructure improvements, better distribution, and Ethereum-alignment. See the [official blog post](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/aavegotchi-has-migrated-to-base/).

### REALM Parcels

REALM parcels were migrated to Base as part of the July 25, 2025 migration.
This includes REALM parcels, installations, tiles, Alchemica, and GLTR.

### Legacy Polygon Access
