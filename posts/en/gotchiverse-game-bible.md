The **Gotchiverse Game Bible** was a public-facing game design document published by Pixelcraft to describe planned Gotchiverse gameplay, economy, and building systems.

## TL;DR

- **2022-01-14:** Pixelcraft announced the **Gotchiverse Game Bible** as an external-facing game design document hosted on GitHub.
- The blog post described a **chapter-by-chapter** release process, with community discussion on the DAO forum and **DAO confirmation via CoreProp**.
- The post included a **time-bound release schedule** for early Gotchiverse milestones (useful historically, but superseded).

## Key facts (from the 2022-01-14 announcement)

### What the document was

- The Game Bible was described as an external-facing game design document intended to complement the Gotchiverse Litepaper by filling in implementation/gameplay details.
- The post described two categories of information:
  - **Confirmed and immutable** — intended to not change except via DAO vote.
  - **Confirmed, but not immutable** — intended to be generally confirmed, but subject to change if underlying assumptions changed (with changes published on official channels).

### How a chapter became canon (as described at the time)

For each chapter:

1) Pixelcraft would publish the chapter.
2) A **DAO forum thread** would be created for discussion.
3) After ~1 week of discussion (if no major issues were raised), Pixelcraft would create a **CoreProp** for AavegotchiDAO to vote to confirm the chapter’s contents.

## Historical: Chapter 1 release schedule (superseded)

The announcement included a **"confirmed, but not immutable"** schedule for the early Gotchiverse rollout. This schedule is included here for historical reference only (it was inherently time-bound and may not match what ultimately shipped).

- **Stress Test 2 — 2022-01-28**
- **Stress Test 3 — mid-February 2022**
- **Gotchiverse Land Auction / Raffle 3 — late February 2022** (described as featuring **10,000 parcels**)
- **Citaadel Live Test — early/mid March 2022** (described as having **real Alchemica pickups** and **"Save Points"** for exiting Alchemica on-chain; no parcel/installation equipping in that release)
- **Gotchi Lending — March 2022**
- **The Gotchiverse (Full Citaadel) — late March / early April 2022**
- **Traits Release — April 2022**
- **Grid Release 1 — early Q3 2022**
