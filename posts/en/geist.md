## TL;DR

- Geist was announced as a gaming-focused chain concept, with ideas like GHST as a gas token, memberships, and ecosystem rewards.
- Geist ultimately **did not launch**; Aavegotchi later migrated to **Base**.

## What Was Announced (Historical Summary)

Geist was announced as a planned L3 powered by Base, Arbitrum, Alchemy, and Aavegotchi.

The announcement described Geist as the onchain home of Aavegotchi, the Aavegotchi Gaming Console, and official and community-built games.

## Features (as described)

The Geist announcement described a chain built using the Arbitrum stack, with goals like fast blocks, a custom gas token ([GHST](/ghst)), and permissionless transacting.

Planned features included:

- **A chain-wide membership program.** Geist Members would have enjoyed access to reward campaigns across games on the chain.
- **World-class uptime and developer tooling.** Described as powered by Alchemy.
- **Native NFT marketplace.** Planned integration with the Aavegotchi [Marketplace (Baazaar)](/marketplace).
- **CEX onramps.** Described as working with Coinbase and other exchanges to support ETH and GHST onramps.
- **Native VRF.** Described as a Pixelcraft-developed onchain randomness system.
- **Account abstraction and gasless relayers.** Described as powered by Thirdweb.
- **Native staking with revenue sharing.** Described as contingent on a future [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) proposal.
- **Permissioned contract deployment.** Intended to prevent congestion and enforce quality control.

## Polter Testnet (as described)

The Geist announcement described a "Polter Testnet" as the testing ground for migrations and features.
