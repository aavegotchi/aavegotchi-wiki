> Geist (also referred to as **Gotchichain** in some announcements) was announced as an Aavegotchi gaming chain concept. It ultimately **did not launch**, and Aavegotchi’s canonical home migrated to **Base** on **2025-07-25**.

## TL;DR

- Geist was described as a gaming-focused chain concept with GHST as a gas token, memberships, and ecosystem rewards.
- Geist ultimately **did not launch**; Aavegotchi later migrated to **Base**.

## What Was Announced (Historical Summary)

The Geist announcement described (at the time) a chain concept focused on:

- Fast blocks and gaming UX.
- A chain-wide membership program and reward campaigns across games.
- Native marketplace support for Aavegotchi assets.
- Onramps, account abstraction / smart wallets, and developer tooling.

Because chain roadmaps and implementations can change, treat these as historical notes, not present-tense guarantees.
