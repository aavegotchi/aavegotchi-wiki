> **Note (Base era):** This page explains how the term “Spirit Force” evolved during the Ethereum and Polygon eras. As of **2025-07-25**, Aavegotchi’s canonical home migrated to **Base**. See **[Migration to Base (2025)](/base-migration)**.


Spirit Force?

Collateral?

aTokens?

maTokens?

amTokens?

Why are there so many different terms?!?!?!?

Let's take a walk down memory lane:

1. The Aavegotchi game was initially designed to be on Ethereum Mainnet. During that period, Spirit Force refers to aTokens, the interest-bearing tokens from the [Aave Protocol](https://aave.com).

2. Due to high gas fees on Ethereum Mainnet, the launch of the Aavegotchi game was shifted to [Polygon](/glossary#polygon), a layer 2 solution. The benefits of shifting to Polygon include near-zero transaction fees and near-instant transactions. 

3. The shift to Polygon meant that we need aTokens on Polygon. Our in-house coding genius and diamondboi, [Nick Mudge](/team#nick-mudge) managed to bridge **Aave V2 aTokens** from Ethereum Mainnet over to Polygon. These are known as **maTokens**. Aavegotchis belonging to Haunt 1 use **maTokens** as their Spirit Force.

4. Subsequently, Aave themselves shifted over to Polygon. Tokens from their Aave (Polygon) markets are known as **amTokens.** From Haunt 2 onwards, the Spirit Force for Aavegotchis will use **amTokens** instead.
