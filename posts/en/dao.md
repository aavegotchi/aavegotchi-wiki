</div>


A DAO is a decentralized form of governance, which allows token holders to vote in order to shape the way the organization makes decisions.

Aavegotchi follows in the footsteps of successful DeFi protocols such as Compound and Synthetix by following a process of “gradual decentralization”, beginning with the founding team, Pixelcraft Studios organizing a DAO-governed token distribution event (DAICO) and culminating in placing governance of Aavegotchi, including all game mechanics, smart contracts, and funding, under the auspices of the AavegotchiDAO, but subject always to the prevailing regulatory environment. This will be accomplished in three phases.

## Genesis

The first iteration of AavegotchiDAO has been launched, in tandem with the GHST token distribution event. GHST token holders will be able to vote on increasing/decreasing a “tap” mechanism that transfers funds from the token bonding curve (TBC) reserve to Pixelcraft to support development. When the time comes to migrate at AavegotchiDAO METAMORPHOSIS, token holders will also vote to perform the migration.

Token holders will not receive rewards in GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.

## Metamorphosis

AavegotchiDAO METAMORPHOSIS is the second iteration of AavegotchiDAO, and is charged with managing simple game mechanics of AavegotchiDAO, such as the total supply of Aavegotchis, adding new collaterals and deciding on their functions, and adding new wearables created by the community. When the time comes to migrate to AavegotchiDAO OASIS, the AavegotchiDAO will again vote to perform the migration.

Token holders will receive rewards in the form of GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.
AavegotchiDAO (OASIS)

## Oasis

Although AavegotchiDAO OASIS is the final iteration of AavegotchiDAO’s evolution, it is only the beginning of the realization of a DAO-governed game. All decisions related to Aavegotchi game mechanics, REALM mechanics, ecosystem spending, and even smart contract upgrades will be voted on by the AavegotchiDAO.

Token holders will receive rewards in GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.
