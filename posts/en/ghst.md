The GHST token is the eco-governance token that powers the whole Aavegotchi ecosystem.

Holding GHST grants the owner voting power in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) at a rate of 1 vote per token. GHST is also the main currency of account for trading NFTs in the [Aavegotchi marketplace](/marketplace).

GHST is live on Base, and Aavegotchi’s canonical home has migrated to Base (historical announcements: 2024-04-17 and 2025-07-25).

## Why GHST


User incentives play a huge part in any project. In this case, GHST provides the economic incentives to encourage greater participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Specifically, the token helps to align the respective goals of the AavegotchiDAO, GHST holders, and Aavegotchi holders.

Players have to buy GHST and spend it within the ecosystem. A portion of this is transferred directly back to the DAO to continue funding the development of the ecosystem. At the same time, part of the value is also distributed as rewards for wise governance in the DAO, and as rewards for engaging in [rarity farming](/rarity-farming).

For more information, make sure to check out the [Tokenomics page](/tokenomics).

## Total supply

GHST was initially launched using a “bonding curve” mechanism where GHST was backed by DAI. However, in 2023, the AavegotchiDAO [voted to remove the bonding curve](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals-2023#close-the-ghst-bonding-curve) and make GHST a free-floating token; the curve was turned off on **2023-03-11**. After the bonding curve was closed, the ~30M DAI collateral backing it was distributed per the terms of AGIP-65. (Sources: [Let the Great GHST Migration Begin! (2023-03-22)](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/let-the-great-ghst-migration-begin/); [Aavegotchi March 2023 Update — “GHST Bonding Curve Closed”](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/aavegotchi-march-2023-update/); [Aavegotchi Dev Update — June 2023](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/aavegotchi-dev-update-june-2023/))

Following the removal of the bonding curve, the total supply of GHST token is now fixed at 52,747,802 GHST.

As GHST will still be burnt through various mechanisms in the Aavegotchi ecosystem, please refer to the contract on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550) for a real-time update of the token's total supply.

## Is GHST decentralized?

Yes, GHST is a fully decentralized token, with no admin privileges or backdoors. Originally deployed under the ownership of AavegotchiDAO, when the bonding curve turned off, the DAO that maintained admin keys to GHST was also dismantled, meaning that no one owns the admin keys to GHST any longer.
