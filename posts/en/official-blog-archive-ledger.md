description: "Tracking durable claims from the official Aavegotchi blog archive and where they live in the wiki"

This ledger tracks reconciliation work between the **official blog archive** (historical announcements) and the **aavegotchi-wiki**.

Goal: ensure **durable claims** are reflected in the wiki with correct **historical framing** (past tense + date) and proper citations.

## Status legend

- **present** — claim is already covered in the wiki (with appropriate framing and citation)
- **partial** — covered, but missing key detail(s) and/or citation(s)
- **missing** — not covered
- **ambiguous** — unclear / potentially risky; needs escalation or more sources

## 2024-04-17 — GHST Token Is Now Live on Base

- Blog URL: https://blog.aavegotchi.com/ghst-token-is-now-live-on-base/

### Durable claims → wiki mapping

1) **2024-04-17: GHST went live on Base** (bridging GHST to Base; “triplechain” framing)
- Wiki target: `posts/en/ghst.md` → “Historical milestones”
- Status: **partial** (now cited + framed; deeper bridge guidance lives on bridge page)

2) **Bridge guidance referenced canonical bridge and fast-bridge options (Superbridge; Bungee/Jumper as coming soon at the time)**
- Wiki target: `posts/en/bridge.md` → “Base Bridges”
- Status: **partial** (citation added; availability intentionally described as time-bound)
