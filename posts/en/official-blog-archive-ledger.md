description: "Tracking durable claims from the official Aavegotchi blog archive and where they live in the wiki"
contributors: ["moss"]

This ledger tracks reconciliation work between the **official blog archive** (historical announcements) and the **aavegotchi-wiki**.

Goal: ensure **durable claims** are reflected in the wiki with correct **historical framing** (past tense + date) and proper citations.

## Status legend

- **present** — claim is already covered in the wiki (with appropriate framing and citation)
- **partial** — covered, but missing key detail(s) and/or citation(s)
- **missing** — not covered
- **ambiguous** — unclear / potentially risky; needs escalation or more sources
