### Tap increase for Scaling Sprint
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #1**

**Proposal Summary:** The GHST Bonding Curve has been live for nearly one month and with that comes the first opportunity for GHST holders to adjust the DAICO’s tap mechanism. AavegotchiDAO 1.0 is built on the Aragon platform and functions as a straightforward DAICO where GHST holders are able to vote once per month to increase or decrease the flow of funds to the core team via the tap. The tap provides DAI directly from the GHST Bonding Curve where over 7.5 million DAI are currently secured.

We request the Aavegotchi community vote to increase the tap from 50K DAI / 30 days to 100K DAI / 30 days. 50k DAI was not enough to cover all of the milestones achieved (community growth, GHST token, game development) and the next sprint is even more ambitious. The hard coded constraints of AavegotchiDAO 1.0 limit this proposal to only a 50K DAI increase for this month’s voting period and thus we have budgeted our strategy with a total 100k DAI tap in mind.

The budget going forward deploys the additional 50k DAI into 4 distinct categories:
* A game maker’s fund so we can solidify terms with key game developers.
* Additional contracts for key positions in marketing, design, and development.
* A marketing boost to make sure Aavegotchi’s presence is expanded.
* Community rewards so we can continue to develop programs (like the Aartists and Aapprentices teams) that incentivize the most inspired in our community.

**Voting Period:** 15 - 19 October 2020

### Add fees to Bonding Curve
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #2**

**Proposal Summary:** The bonding curve is the main source of liquidity of GHST. Large buyers and sellers can currently buy in and out without any fees.

Our market maker offers the ability to add fees to buy and sell orders.

Multiple community members have proposed adding fees up to 0.3% to buying and selling on the curve.

This is possible to do by calling the `updateFees` function on our bonding curve, but should we? It’s up to you, AavegotchiDAO.

Any fees earned would automatically be transferred to the DAO Treasury address at 0xffe6280ae4e864d9af836b562359fd828ece8020 and would be considered as assets of AavegotchiDAO.

**Voting Period:** 18 - 21 January 2021

### Increase DAICO tap for GHST purchases
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #3**

**Proposal Summary:** Player rewards and liquidity incentives are crucial to bootstrapping the Aavegotchi ecosystem to a level where it becomes self-sustained on trading volume and economic activity.

Whenever GHST is spent in the Aavegotchi ecosystem, 33% of it is automatically sent to a burn address. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, burning GHST (except via the bonding curve) does not actually lower the total value of GHST, since that value is stored as DAI within the bonding curve.

What burning does do is trap DAI within the bonding curve, essentially increasing the reserve ratio over time, which stabilizes the price of GHST.

In order to offset the burning (which could ultimately turn GHST into a stablecoin), we advise the community to increase the tap to 150,000 DAI per month. This will help balance the reserve of the bonding curve, while also providing an extra 50,000 DAI per month that will be put towards player rewards and liquidity incentives.

**Voting Period:** 18 - 21 January 2021

### Proposal for Haunt 2
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #4**

**Proposal Summary:** 10,000 Portals is arguably not enough to satisfy the current level of demand for Aavegotchis. Therefore it may be necessary to deploy a new Haunt to ensure that all who want to participate can own an Aavegotchi. This Core Proposal provides four different options that have been suggested by community members, including one option not to create a new Haunt.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-when-haunt-2-making-haunts-more-unique-d975cbda4772).

Option 1: No new haunt, Revisit in a month

Option 2: 10K Portals, 100 GHST each, 1 per txn

Option 3: 25K portals, 100 GHST each, 5 per txn (w/ stricter ape tax)

Option 4: Pre-sale, in which each wallet can subscribe for 1 Portal in exchange for 100 GHST. When the pre-sale period closes, all Portals are minted and transferred to their owners.

**Voting Period:** 17 - 24 March 2021

### Give unique non-transferable Background to Haunt 1 Aavegotchis
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #5**

**Proposal Summary:** Many players are worried that Haunt 2 will be too similar to Haunt 1 and the newly-created [Haunts](/haunt) will devalue the “Genesis” Haunt. One of the suggestions is to give special backgrounds to each Haunt to make them easily identifiable. This proposal has seen excellent discussion and significant support on the associated Snapshot. Note that irrespective of the DAO’s decision on this issue, all Aavegotchis will be getting special non-transferable "Haunt" badges that identify their Haunt. This proposal focuses specifically on the idea of a non-transferable background that can be equipped in the Aavegotchi’s BG wearable slot.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-when-haunt-2-making-haunts-more-unique-d975cbda4772).

Option 1: Only Haunt 1 should get a special background

Option 2: Each Haunts should have it’s own unique background

Option 3: Neither, leave it as is

**Voting Period:** 17 - 24 March 2021

### Add Fee on Baazaar to Support Rarity Farming
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #6**

**Proposal Summary:** With the announcement of SZN1 Rewards now official, we explore how to align the community's interests and rewards structures, as it pertains to Baazaar fees.

Currently, 2% is allocated to Pixelcraft and 1% to DAO treasury. While not exclusive of providing for RF rewards, the treasury funds are currently in no obligation to be allocated in any form of ratio towards the RF pool each season. The proposal aims to increase the Baazaar fees from 3% to 3.5%, with the additional 0.5% going directly to the Rarity Farming rewards pool.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/core-proposal-agip6-add-0-5-fee-on-baazaar-to-support-rarity-farming-5bf923c7f528).

Option 1: Yes, increase fees from 3 to 3.5

Option 2: No, leave the fees as they are

### Earn XP for Successful Signal Proposals
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #7**

**Proposal Summary:** We currently have a lot of Signal / Community Proposals on Snapshot and new posts on our forum everyday. So far none of those proposals were able to even get close to the quorum of 20%. The most popular one by @JG about adding additional fees for rarity farming only got around 2 million GHST in votes (~11%)-even though the team decided to take it as a Core Proposal. After being upgraded to Core we smashed right through the quorum in less than 24h.

I think there are two pretty obvious reasons for this. On the one hand, our Snapshot is a bit chaotic right now, with some Signal Proposals not following the template at all. On the other hand-and I think this is the more important one-voting on Core Proposal gets you 20 Experience (XP) for your Gotchi.

I propose adding a small Experience drop (10 XP) for people who voted on successful Signal Proposals, meaning ones that reach quorum and get upgraded to Core Proposals. Simply dropping XP for all Community Proposals could result in more low quality suggestions, which shouldn't be the goal of this proposal.

Even if 10 XP might not be much, it gives people incentives to actually look through the Signal Proposals and vote on quality proposals with a higher chance of reaching quorum. As a DAO, community involvement is extremely important and I believe this is a small, but decent, step in the right direction.

If this Proposal reaches quorum and passes, all Aavegotchis held by their owners at the end of the vote will receive 10 XP!

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-agip7-earn-xp-for-successful-signal-proposals-d5eafdb93aae).

Option 1: Yes, successful SigProps give XP

Option 2: No, SigProps should not give XP

### Partnership between AavegotchiDAO, Pixelcraft, and DinoSwap
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #10**

**Proposal Summary:** Some community members are worried about the waning liquidity of GHST on Quickswap and their gradually decreasing LP rewards. Rather than simply allocating more liquidity to the pool, we are considering partnering with a soon to launch liquidity aggregator called DinoSwap. The terms include a total of 200k USD worth of GHST tokens to be allocated to their incentivized “extinction pools”, the details of which are fleshed out below.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/ghst-liquidity-rewards-on-new-launch-pixelcraft-dao-collaboration/1804).

Option 1: Yes, let's partner with DinoSwap

Option 2: No, don't partner with Dinoswap

### Liquidity Manager / FRENS Committee
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #11**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem*

To incentivize liquidity on QuickSwap, you can earn additional FRENS rewards for staking Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens on the Aavegotchi website. Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.

*Solution*

Quoted from [coderdan](/team#coder-dan): "There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.”

The “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee."

For now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc.

*Candidates*

Two weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.

So now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:

Angst, Jarrod, Kenymccornick, UnfitStone, Notorious_BTC, Doxy, Kokusho, Grip, Almond-Stew, Shanekoy and Moon

### Launch Haunt 2
**Core Prop**

**Proposal Summary:** Currently Aavegotchis are limited by a maximum possible 10,000 because only that many Haunt 1 Portals exist. This makes acquiring a first Aavegotchi cost prohibitive. With a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals, we aim to address this problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.

Our vision is for far wider adoption of playable NFTs, and the first step to achieving that means leaving the scarcity memes behind and focusing on being able to offer meaningfully unique experiences to more people.

Option 1: Yes, launch Haunt 2

Option 2: No, do not launch Haunt 2 now

### Add an Aging Mechanic to affect Aavegotchi rarity scores
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #13**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem*

As new haunts are released, whether or not they include a bug fix that impacts gotchi trait generation, a strong dilution of existing high BRS gotchis occurs. Due to the nature of rarity farming and its rewards, this dilution is exclusively felt by those who invested heavily into older haunts, and who may not have the desire to sell due to emotional attachment, the means to invest more, or the ability to “flip” their way (due to local tax laws) into higher BRS gotchis from the newer haunts. Furthermore, very significant statistical variance can occur in new haunts, making it near impossible to make long term financial decisions, as the variance can render previous haunt gotchis all but obsolete. This leaves far too much entirely up to “luck”.

*Solution*

The Aging Mechanic is a proposal, initially introduced by Tistou on discord, that is designed to address all of the above mentioned issues, as well as create an interesting new dynamic of Aavegotchis that can be built upon in the future (age limits for activities, wearables, new appearance qualities, etc). It provides a buffer of approximately 6 months during which older gotchis have a BRS boost over newly summoned gotchis. As newly summoned gotchis age, they quickly begin to catch up to their older counterparts.

In the spirit of using numbers occurring in nature, the formula is modeled after the Fibonacci numbers x 1 million, but replacing the first 0 with a 1 to better fit the use case. Specifically, the first 10 Fibonacci numbers (replacing the first 0) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, the sum of which is 89. Following this formula would mean +1 BRS after 1 million blocks, then another +1 BRS after 2 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 3 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 5 million blocks, …, up to a final sum of +10 BRS after 89 million blocks (approx 6.5 years using average block time of 2.3 seconds — the average since May 1st).

This solution provides for a quicker boost in the first few epochs of age, and greatly flattens over time to avoid anything too OP and allow more recently summoned gotchis to eventually catch up to within a 1 BRS boost of their older and wiser brethren. It incentivizes opening and summoning portals as opposed to sitting on them, both boosting the in-game economy as well as the scarcity of those that are still chosen to remain closed. Most of all, it is a fair system that benefits no one haunt over any other, and simply rewards long term engagement, while counteracting the effects of sudden and aggressive dilution like we are currently witnessing.

*Modifications made to Solution*

* **The implementation will be slightly modified to use the available onchain data of birth block timestamp as opposed to block number,** with epoch times predetermined using the same fibonacci intervals proposed in the sigprop and the current average block time. This makes the implementation much simpler, allows for predictable timelines (since a block time denominator would be constant, as opposed to variable based on chain activity), as well as ensures the functionality of the mechanic should any potential cases of architecture or blockchain network changes occur in the future. The petting time intervals already function using real time, so a precedent for this exists.

* **The 10 BRS cap is removed.** The fibonacci intervals themselves act as a natural cap, as the time to reach further epochs approximates an exponential function. For example, it will take over 4 more years to get an additional BRS bonus (+11 total), then 6.5 years for another, then 10.5 years, etc.

* **The implementation would go live prior to the beginning of Rarity Farming Season 2.** One of the goals of aging is to provide a short term buffer to the effects of statistical variance once a new haunt is released. For Haunt 1’s to be able to experience any of this benefit at all, the implementation must go live as soon as possible, as by the middle of season 2 H2’s will already be mostly caught up to the H1 bonus, with only a 1–2 BRS difference.

Option 1: Yes, implement aging incentives

### Earn FRENS with GHST-MATIC LP Tokens
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #14**

**Proposal Summary:** Polygon has been a huge reason behind the success of Aavegotchi. Super low transaction fees paid in MATIC have enabled the team to build a game where there is lots of activity happening on-chain such as petting, bid to earn auctions, Baazaar sales, and storage of the Aavegotchi game art.

As of early September, Sushiswap started offering 2x SUSHI rewards for farming the GHST-MATIC LP pair on Sushiswap.

The FRENS Taask Force recommends enabling a FRENS incentive to be paid for the GHST-MATIC LP pair on their AMM.

We recommend that the target rate of FRENS paid to the GHST-MATIC LP pair is greater than the target incentive for the GHST-ETH LP pair (120%) but lower than the target incentive for the GHST-QUICK pair (135%).

This is because the Impermanent Loss (IL) risk for GHST-MATIC is higher compared to GHST-ETH but lower compared to GHST-QUICK. We would recommend a target rate of 130% for the GHST-MATIC LP pair.

Currently, the majority of the liquidity for GHST resides on Quickswap.

See: [https://frens-taaskforce.vercel.app/](https://frens-taaskforce.vercel.app/)

This offers a great opportunity to move some of the liquidity over to the widely adopted Sushiswap AMM and reduce our dependence on Quickswap.

### Create a Wearables Taask Force
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #15**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Motivation*

Within the Aavegotchi ecosystem wearables play a vital role, whether it be boosting BRS for rarity farming, improving traits for minigames, utility in the upcoming metaverse, or just showing off. Due to the complexity of the different possible trait ranges of gotchis, and the variety of possible wearable stats, it is not an easy task to arrive at a balanced distribution of equippable items. Releasing new wearables without proper analysis can lead to duplication (and dilution) of existing items and further skew of practical applicable sets for gotchis with trait ranges in certain directions.

*Specification*

This proposal aims to introduce a Wearables Taask Force (WTF), the idea of which arose from discussions regarding the above concerns. Akin to the FRENS Taask Force, the goal of the WTF would be to assist Pixelcraft in the analysis of the current distribution of items within the ecosystem from a slot, rarity, and trait modifiers perspective, and in how this analysis can best be applied to future items. This Taask Force would NOT have the unilateral ability to determine what and how new items are released, but would function entirely in an advisory capacity.

*Nominees*

The nominees for the Taask Force include long term community members who have a wide range of applicable skills, including statistical analysis, programming ability, strong experience in baazaar activity, and prior DAO experience. This Taask Force would greatly benefit from as many voices and perspectives as possible, so all nominations are included. Establishing this Taask Force would be a major step forward in creating a more balanced ecosystem and helping the AavegotchiDAO mature.

**Full list of nominees:** Kuwlness, JG1 (Fantasma#1777), Bearded, Actaeon, Thunderfish, Letsgobankless, Kokusho, Ader1990.eth, Machete, Aimo217 (AL#4105), Notorious_BTC, MonsterRNG, Goobz, Diddlypoo

### Stake 100k GHST to generate Minigame Rewards
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #16**

**Proposal Summary:** Some frens have expressed concern over the lack of rewards for participating in Minigame events. Since there currently exists no Aarcade Taask Force with a designated budget, Gotchinomics has come up with the idea of staking 100k GHST in Treasury funds to support future initiatives.

*Problem*

Aavegotchi aims to be one of the top Play2Earn projects in the crypto gaming space, the launch of the Gotchiverse Realm being the cornerstone to achieving this long-term goal. However, there is room for improving the short-term possibilities through seasonal gaming events. The main problem is the lack of structure and funds.

*Solution*

Before creating a dedicated Aarcade DAO, the first step to enable play2earn rewards is to create a sustainable stream of funds. A simple and low-risk solution would be to stake a portion of the main DAO treasury, such as 100k GHST, to generate FRENS. Those could be then transformed into raffle tickets and given away to mini-game players through periodic events.

*Potential risks*

Staking GHST will indirectly imply a dilution of FRENS/tickets. However, since they would be distributed via mini-game rewards, the impact should be minimal compared to the boost on engagement and appeal to new people.

*Alternatives*

Wait for the Aarcade DAO to launch and let the new committee decide how to designate funds. However, this alternative option would mean losing precious time to generate more attractive rewards.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128)

Option 1: Yes, stake 100k GHST

Option 2: No, wait for Aarcade DAO

### Adding Voting Power to REALM Parcels
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #17**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem:*

With a new asset class added to the Aavegotchi family in the form of realm plots comes a new sink of GHST. This currently leaves those who have heavily invested into the new plots with much lesser voting power in the Aavegotchi DAO.

*Solution:*

Since realm plots and the Gotchiverse are such an integral part of the Aavegotchi ecosystem, I believe it’s only right that realm owners get an amount of voting power that is proportional to the size of their realm plots. This ensures that their vote can be heard, which is of particular importance when future governance proposals will concern the Gotchiverse.

Since every plot has a set size in pixels which is also a scaling factor for the amount of alchemica within the plot, the suggestion brought forward is:

1 pixel = 1 GHST worth of voting power (64, 256, 2056) OR 1 pixel = 0.5 GHST worth of voting power (32, 128, 1028)

An alternative would be to give every plot flat voting power based on the auction floor, with a vote afterward allowing for fine-tuning of final voting power amounts while ensuring that all land owners will have a say.

This would give 100, 200, and 1300 GHST worth of voting power to humbles, reasonables, and spacious parcels, respectively.

*CoreProp Edits*

An option for “Auction floor” has also been added. This brings the Vote Differential up to 20%, meaning that any option must have 20% higher than the next option to pass.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/voting-power-for-land-plots/2508)

Option 1: Voting power of 0.5 GHST/pixel

Option 2: Voting power of 1 GHST/pixel

Option 3: Voting power from auction floor

Option 4: No voting power for REALM

### Gotchiverse Patch v0.1
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #18**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem:*

Although the Gotchiverse is not yet live, we have identified a few areas that we believe should be adjusted before the game is released, and would like to bring these items to the community’s attention for discussion and a decision on whether or not to enact.

To ensure no single proposed change can revert the entire batch, we originally created six separate snapshot SigProp Proposals. This CoreProp combines the successful SigProps into the first Gotchiverse Patch v0.1!

*Solution:*

Patch 0.1a

As we were finalizing key details such as build costs and harvesting rates for the upcoming Whitepaper, we discovered that one of our key assumptions had undervalued the amount of Alchemica in each parcel relative to total supply. The patch will increase the amount of Alchemica under each parcel to match our initial Alchemica tokens’ supplies, allocations, and emissions rates.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1a passed with the following numbers:

Yes: 13.14M GHST

No: 41.85k GHST

Patch 0.1b

Although our original intention was to make boosts one-time only, it is clear that many in the community interpreted the GEO paper to mean that boosts would be replenished. This patch allows boosts to also replenish together with the parcel itself after each Great Battle.

However, unlike parcels, the replenish rate is a fixed amount that is the same per round. For example, a parcel with a “5” FUD boost receives 5 servings of FUD per boost round.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1b also passed pretty convincingly:

Yes: 10.36M GHST

No: 2.37M GHST

Patch 0.1c

Even with Patch 0.1b passed, boosts will still be undervalued compared to the value the market has assigned to them, relative to a similar parcel with no boosts. Patch 0.1c proposed increasing boosts by 5x to bring the value of a boost closer to what the market is currently valuing it at.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1c did not pass and WILL NOT BE INCLUDED in Patch v0.1:

Yes: 5.85M GHST

No: 8.04M GHST

Future SigProps may be created to address this issue separately.

Patch 0.1d

The Gotchiverse Litepaper mentions that Kinship will be exchanged for a serving of Alchemica, essentially “burning” kinship. We certainly want to maintain the idea of a “kinship boost” for channeling but after thinking more deeply, we now believe there is a better way to achieve this.

An “achievements” approach does not require depleting an Aavegotchi’s kinship. Instead, high kinship Aavegotchis will channel Alchemica at a slightly higher rate, depending on their achievement level.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1d also passed:

Yes: 12.64M GHST

No: 431.93k GHST

Patch 0.1e & 0.1f

Districts did not exist as a Citaadel concept when the Litepaper was first published. That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi’s need for its own virtual world.

Patch 0.1e & 0.1f proposed allocating 1000 parcels each to Pixelcraft and the AavegotchiDAO in D27/D30. Both Patches passed convincingly:

Yes: 11.94M GHST / 12.14M GHST

No: 615.78k GHST / 734.92k GHST

Conclusion

And that’s it for the first Gotchiverse Patch! Now it is up to you, the AavegotchiDAO, to decide if Patch v0.1 should be implemented or not.

Option 1: Yes, implement Patch v0.1

Option 2: No, do not implement Patch v0.1

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchiverse-paatch-v0-1-thread/2791)

Option 1: Yes, implement Patch v0.1

Option 2: No, do not implement Patch v0.1

### Providing GHST Liquidity on SynFutures
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #19**

**Proposal Summary:**

Since Aavegotchi has gathered a lot of liquidity on Spot DEXes, it is high time for Aavegotchi to create and boost its Futures market. Derivatives markets make up the majority of global trading activity and allow users to leverage their investments. Adding GHST liquidity on SynFutures would allow people to take on leverage longs (or shorts) on the future of Aavegotchi. But why SynFutures?

Great investors and team background SynFutures is backed by Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Framework, Standard Crypto, Woo, and more. The team’s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s).

Security Backed by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.

Easy to manage and start SynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.

Growth Potential Trading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume. All this happened without a native SynFutures token, which could attract even more users.

Volume analysis Quickswap vs. SynFutures: Total LPs: 150k / 40K Total traders: 100k / 20k Daily trading volume: $100M / $29M

SynFutures trading volume makes up ~1/3rd of QuickSwap, and the amount of traders is 1/5th as big as on QuickSwap, however, the trading volume for different pairs is more concentrated. SynFutures has 108 trading pairs while QuickSwap has more than 22k pairs. For example, the daily trading volume of MATIC-USDC on SynFutures closes in on around $9M, while Quickswap reaches $14M.

### Creating the DAO Treasury Taask Force
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #20**

**Proposal Summary:**

We propose the creation of the DAO Treasury Taask Force (DTF). This committee will initially be composed of 8 members with reassessment of membership by the DAO within 6 months.

As of 12/07/2021, the DAO Treasury (https://aavegotchi.com/treasury) boasts nearly ~$11,408,400 worth of DAI and GHST. In its initial form, the committee will form proposals for consideration by the DAO which will subsequently be voted on and, if passed, enacted.

Proposed Mission Statement

The Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Taask Force is a dynamic committee assigned with making DAO treasury management proposals to the community and DAO for consideration. The initial mission and goals of the committee will be: 1) Grow and optimize the DAO treasury with an emphasis on safety, security and transparency; 2) Partner with Pixelcraft to assist in developing and identifying tools and infrastructure for ongoing DAO Treasury management; and 3) foster and encourage growth of the overall Aavegotchi community by increasing awareness, actively promoting adoption, and maintaining current user engagement.

Initial Funding

After lengthy discussions with the task force, the community, and with coderdan, the DTF would like to request an initial 50,000 GHST budget. The 50,000 GHST budget would be transferred from the DAO Treasury to the 8 multi-signature Gnosis Safe. This budget will greatly expand the flexibility of the DAO in incentivizing and rewarding engaged community members, developers, creatives, and overall contributors. This budget will never be used to reward members of the DTF. The DTF’s core main initiative will be to form a proposal for overall use of the DAO Treasury by investing some of the $10 million DAI/GHST in yield bearing opportunities. With effective deployment of the DAO Treasury, even modest returns would more than pay for the DTF budget request. The DTF will ensure comprehensive accounting and provide community facing documentation to ensure transparency. Some potential uses for the budget include the following:

* Reward community engagement and aarcade play
* Reward game developers and designers
* Reward community application developers
* Reward and acknowledge community art contributions
* Reward, acknowledge and grow content creators and general marketing efforts
* Expand Aavegotchi and GHST’s opportunities for decentralized financial applications

The DTF is developing a structured plan and multiple potential pilot projects to best utilize these funds. We will work to develop tools to allow maximum transparency into the budget use. Expenses within this 50,000 GHST budget would not require a DAO approval in order to maximize nimble use of the funds. Any further budget requests beyond the initial 50,000 GHST would require a DAO vote.

The initial 8 members of the DTF

* BowtiedNerd
* Mori
* letsgobankless
* Addison
* Deucehearts
* BackfireCapital
* Swappi
* Dr Wagmi

We appreciate the Aavegotchi community’s support and look forward to our first proposal.

### Adding GHST to the Umbria Narni Bridge
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #21**

**Proposal Summary:**

The Umbria Narni Bridge has implemented the GHST token, and is facilitating cheaper migration of GHST between the Ethereum <--> Polygon networks, compared to the official Polygon bridge. The Umbria Narni bridging cost is about 1/2 of the official polygon bridge cost and is also much faster (4 minutes, as opposed to > 1 hour).

The Umbria Narni bridge protocol can bridge a maximum of 20% of its total GHST liquidity, per bridging event. For example, with $100k of GHST tokens in one side of the pool, the bridge can migrate a maximum of $20k of GHST per single transaction.

Currently there is approximately $14,000 of GHST tokens on each side of the bridge. This is mostly funded by the Umbria team. This enables the bridge to be able to bridge a maximum of $700 of GHST tokens per transaction - which is pretty good, but we are aware that some users want to bridge much more in a single transaction.

We propose the Aavegotchi DAO add $100,000 of GHST to each bridge pool (1. Polygon and 2. Ethereum). There are a few advantages for doing so:

The Aavegotchi DAO will earn a 0.2% bridging fee whenever anyone uses the bridge to migrate GHST tokens between Ethereum <--> Polygon. So across time, the Aavegotchi DAO will make money. If the Narni bridge ever becomes an unnecessary solution, the Aavegotchi DAO can easily remove their liquidity and enjoy their profit.

Transactions up to approximately $21,000 of GHST will now be possible.

Option 1: Yes, add $200k GHST

Option 2: No, do not add any GHST

### Launch Rarity Farming SZN 3
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #22**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem*

Currently, Rarity Farming Seasons happen sporadically and are difficult to account for in the cadence of Aavegotchi releases. It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their Gotchis and Wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty / predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes.

*Solution*

If possible funding-wise, Rarity Farming should happen three times a year. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM Sales in-between seasons, Treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the Umbra Bridge proposal), and other streams of revenue such as DAO Grants. The author of this proposal believes Rarity Farming is an essential part of the Gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.

*Distribution*

For Season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in Rarity Farming Season 1. The rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys. This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard, 20% to the Kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard.

Based on Forum discussions this would be the final model for SZN3:

* 4 Rounds (2 weeks each)
* 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool (1.4m GHST funded already)
* 70% BRS
* 20% Kinship
* 10% XP
* Top 5k Gotchis (20%) → Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)
* 3 Seasons per Year (approx. schedule below)
* SZN 3: February - March
* SZN 4: June - July

### Co-Sponsoring the GoodGhosting Pool
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #23**

**Proposal Summary:**

*What is GoodGhosting?*

GoodGhosting is a no-loss savings game, built on top of Aave. We launched our very first DeFi savings pools on Polygon, during the summer of 2021. So far, we have helped over 7000 users to save over $600k worth of assets on Polygon. All while collecting some nice NFTs and climbing our leaderboard.

The GoodGhosting team believes in a world where saving is rewarding, easy and fun. Yet, traditional saving is none of that. We build decentralized social saving applications that combine game design elements with goal-based saving. We want to help our community to develop better financial habits, and have fun at the same time.

*Potential collaboration*

We want to expose the GoodGhosting community to Aavegotchi, by introducing an Aavegotchi-themed savings pool. This pool will require players to save in GHST tokens, and earn them more GHST on top. We see it as a fun opportunity to cross-pollinate the GoodGhosting and Aavegotchi communities.

Aavegotchi is a one-of-a-kind project we have been keeping a close eye on from the very start. Both as players and as ecosystem residents. In our opinion, it envisions everything that DeFi and Web3 is about 👻

Besides inviting all Aavegotchi users and the DAO itself to participate in the upcoming GHST savings pool, GoodGhosting would like to request the AavegotchiDAO to consider co-sponsoring this pool.

*Our Request*

* A total of 7000 GHST in sponsorship for this savings pool. To be shared between all winning players.
* The ability to reward successful savers with Gotchi XP, or alternatively FRENS. Considering GoodGhosting an extensive mini-game that encourages people to stack more GHST.
* An allocation of Aavegotchi NFTs (worth up to 3000 GHST) to be raffled to random participants and/or to all winners. These could be Wearables, Gotchi’s, Raffle tickets or Realm parcels.

These could either be provided by the AavegotchiDAO, or alternatively purchased by the GoodGhosting team on the Bazaar. For these additional incentives, we hope to provide benefits to a small handful of lucky winners (via a raffle system), and/or a smaller reward that is feasible to be delivered to all winners.

*What can GoodGhosting bring to the table?*

* Up to 4000 WMATIC tokens in sponsorship (from our DeFiForAll grant). To be shared between all winning players.
* An influx of new users into the Aavegotchi ecosystem. So far over 20500 users joined our Celo and Polygon savings pools. Most have not yet been exposed to Aavegotchi or GHST, and many are likely to join the Gotchigang.
* We will create a YouTube video explaining Aavegotchi, and how to obtain the GHST token on Polygon. Directed at our community members.
* We will allow users to play GoodGhosting using their Aavegotchis as avatar. This will show up in the shared ‘Players’ tab, as well as in the individual player profiles on Goodghosting.com
* Some very special NFTs by our in-house artist Mali3D
* An increased GG score for all successful savers

### Deposit 3M Treasury GHST into Aave
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #24**

**Proposal Summary:**

Alongside the DAO Treasury Taask Force (DTF), Dr Wagmi proposes that we immediately take advantage of the Aave GHST listing by depositing ~80% of our DAO Treasury GHST (3,000,000 GHST) into Aave as collateral to earn passive yield. The current utilisation rate is at 45% with a deposit APR ~2.5%. Given the significant yield and quickly growing utility of the GHST token, we anticipate ongoing borrowing demand, and, thus, yield for GHST depositors and the DAO Treasury. The Aavegotchi DAO can demonstrate its dexterity, effectiveness, and impressive treasury by quickly capitalizing on this passive yield opportunity. This would speak volumes to the broader DeFi and crypto community and immediately provide additional value to GHST token holders through increased borrowing capacity in the Aave pool.

An initial deposit of 3,000,000 GHST would represent approximately 80% of the DAO Treasury GHST. This deposit is completely liquid and could be withdrawn if the DAO designates other uses. A 3% APR is nearly $90,000 which can be used to further invest in the Aavegotchi ecosystem through DAO initiatives. A separate proposal can be considered for the additional 20% and for the 2.4M DAI in the treasury. We do not propose that the received amGHST from this proposed initial deposit be staked for FRENS. This proposal is not requesting DTF multi-sig control over this deposit or the ongoing management.

### Delay Gotchiverse Land Auction & Raffle 3
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #25**

**Proposal Summary:**

Pixelcraft has provided a schedule in Chapter 1 in the Gotchiverse Game Bible with the Gotchiverse Land Auction / Raffle 3 scheduled to occur Late February: [https://blog.aavegotchi.com/introducing-the-gotchiverse-game-bible/](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/introducing-the-gotchiverse-game-bible/)

This was scheduled to happen before the following Gotchiverse Game Bible Chapters were published according to that same post. 4 more Chapters were released in March and there are more planned to be released during the following weeks/months.

I propose the Land Auction & Raffle is delayed until the full release of Book One of the Gotchiverse occurs or the community votes for an additional sale.

This is primarily to ensure that the community can make fully informed bids/investments in Land and we reduce the risk of repeating what happened previously with people overbidding and getting rekt.

[CoreProp Edit: Since Book One is going to be fully published soon but there still seems to be little appetite for a REALM Sale, we have added a voting option to only start the next Auction & Raffle if a SigProp reaches Quorum and the respective CoreProp passes. This adjustment has been discussed with Jarrod beforehand.]

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/chapter-1-the-gotchiverse-release-schedule/2939)

Option 1: Delay until full Book 1

Option 2: Delay until Community Proposal

### Reducing the Parcel VRF Variance
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #26**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem:*

The VRF variance for Alchemica under the ground of parcels (0.2 - 1.8 of average) seems very high to me and could lead to some people getting rekt - see the graphic posted on the Discourse Thread.

A very unlucky spacious owner could get less alchemica than a lucky reasonable owner - which is in my opinion very bad UX, especially considering that it was communicated this wouldn’t be possible. Keep in mind that the first round (quarter) will distribute more Alchemica than the rest of them, so losing big in the first round could set someone back by a lot.

*Solution*

I want to propose lowering the variance to AT LEAST 0.5 - 1.5 if not even 0.75 - 1.25 for the first round (Voting Choice 1). My issue with this very high variance is that people made financial decisions based on the average numbers published before the first auction, making people lose 50-80% of Alchemica value underneath the parcel is terrible UX to me.

Another option suggested by Mori would be to create a binomial distribution with the left tail cut off, so it's possible to win big but impossible to get rekt hard (Voting Choice 2). This results in an average pull of 100, a minimum pull of 60, and a maximum pull of ~800. There's a fairly reasonable chance of winning this top prize, with ~0.02% of parcels being able to achieve this. Important note: This option would reduce the previous Median of 100 to roughly 83.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reducing-the-vrf-variance-for-parcels/3069)

Option 1: Round 1 0.75 - 1.25 & 0.5 - 1.5

Option 2: Binomial Distribution

Option 3: No, don't change the Variance

### Alternative Gotchiverse Trait Mapping
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #27**

**Proposal Summary:**

With the introduction of Gotchiverse trait maps in the Game Bible Chapter 2, a significant discussion kicked off analyzing potential imbalances, weaknesses and areas for innovation in the original proposed trait map for NRG, AGG, SPK & BRN. This CoreProp proposes to change the trait mappings for these 4 traits to:

NRG: HP Capacity (0 NRG) <===> AP Capacity (100 NRG)

AGG: Defense Power (0 AGG) <===> Action Speed (100 AGG)

SPK: HP & AP Regen (0 SPK) <===> Ethereality (100 SPK)

BRN: Melee Power (0 BRN) <===> Ranged Power (100 BRN)

EYS: To Be Confirmed

EYC: To Be Confirmed

Please refer to the DAO forum thread for a full rundown on what these changes mean (including an FAQ section).

Core Effects of the New Trait Map

* Movement speed removed from trait maps will now lead to an improved quality of life user experience (UX) for all players starting out in the Gotchiverse, both new and old,
* Carrying capacity removed from trait maps corrects the imbalance of 1 farming trait vs. 7 combat traits on NRG, AGG, SPK and BRN,
* There is now a clear distinction between physical and ability specialist (mage) gotchis,
* There is now a clear distinction between melee and ranged gotchis,
* Ethereality can now be thought of as “Luck” and influences evasion, critical strikes, slipping through walls and all sorts of other chance based actions in the Gotchiverse.

*End Goal*

For the community and Pixelcraft to build a trait map together that is balanced, has excellent UX, playability and longevity while simultaneously allowing the flexibility to implement wearable buffs and abilities that work with the traits in the future.

*Risks*

There is potential that some players and investors have already purchased gotchis based on the original trait mappings. It is important to note that these traits were always specified as non-immutable in the Game Bible HOWEVER, we strongly believe the new trait maps proposed here will create even moar diverse and entertaining play styles for OG investors and new players alike to experiment with and enjoy playing.

*Final Important Notes*

There are a number of ways these Traits can scale (Yin/Yang linear, asymmetric, buff only starting from 50 and diminishing returns to name a few). The Trait Scaling System is still under review by the community so look forward to further calls with Pixelcraft (to really get into the nitty gritty) and another SigProp! EYS and EYC are still under review by the community. A number of interesting ideas including farming/alchemica/HUD abilities have been proposed. Make sure you get involved and have your say on how you’d like to see these evolve too!

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/alternative-gotchiverse-trait-mapping-for-nrg-agg-spk-brn/3135)

Option 1: Yes, use the new Trait Map

### Extending the DAO Treasury Task Force Multisig
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #28**

**Proposal Summary:**

Hi frens, in Chapter 2 we proposed that 10% of the Gotchus Alchemica supply be vested over 30 years to be used for Ecosystem purposes. The primary goal of this allocation is to ensure excellent long-term liquidity across many platforms, including the GAX, various DEXes on Polygon, Mainnet, and even CEXes.

Those who follow the project carefully know that we always try to do everything “by the book”, to make Aavegotchi a model case study for decentralization and legal compliance. We are currently in the final stages of setting up a new legal wrapper for AavegotchiDAO (more specifically, a Panama Foundation) and will soon be making an announcement for applications to serve.

On the technical side, we are also working to implement onchain governance of the Aavegotchi protocol. However, this will take some time, as it requires upgrades to the deployed GHST token on Polygon.

While all of this is happening in the background, we are also launching FIVE new ERC20 Alchemica tokens and locking a sizable amount of them into vesting contracts.

For both legal and strategic reasons, we believe that the Ecosystem allocation should not be managed by Pixelcraft, but instead by AavegotchiDAO. The DAO Treasury Force has already been created to manage some of the DAO treasury, but the number of signers is quite few (six) and in my opinion insufficient to hold such a sum of funds.

Therefore, I propose we create an additional multisig under the current DTF, with fifteen signers instead of the current six. **Eleven** out of fifteen signatures would be required to confirm transactions.

This multisig would be the beneficiary of the Ecosystem Vesting Contract (which holds 10% of each Alchemica’s token supply, vested over 30 years), and could also inherit the 1M GHST originally allocated during the GHST creation for Ecosystem building, to help bootstrap Alchemica liquidity.

On our side, we will deploy the Alchemica and create initial liquidity pools on Quickswap, after which we will transfer ownership of the vesting contract to the multisig. After that point, it will be up to the DTF to coordinate liquidity provision.

Let’s goooo Gotchigang!

### 24h Windows for Alchemical Channeling
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #29**

**Proposal Summary:**

As specified in Gotchiverse Bible Chapter 3, solo gotchi channeling will work via a 24 hour cooldown timer that starts immediately after a gotchi channels at an altar. We propose that this be revised to a windowed 24 hour system that runs from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC in which a gotchi can solo channel once, anytime within that 24 hour window.

*TIMELINE*

Proposal to be implemented on or before May 18, 2022 (the commencement date of solo channeling) or as soon thereafter as Pixelcraft can ship...

*RATIONALE*

With the introduction of the 12 hour petting cooldown system a year ago, we have all come to realize that a set interaction time with your gotchi is hard to maintain given real world events, network congestion, family and work commitments. We do not want to repeat this limitation with solo gotchi channeling.

The above limitation has led to the development of automated bots to guarantee interaction efficiency which, arguably, results in lower user engagement. By removing this limitation for solo channeling, it is much more likely that players will organically engage with their gotchi for solo channeling on a daily basis.

Many players have multiple gotchis, multiple parcels and multiple altars spread all throughout the Citaadel. These players have shown amazing support in our community and should not be restricted in their efficiency by a 24 hour cooldown. They should still be able to comfortably channel once per day with all their gotchis when their busy schedules suit.

*BENEFITS*

The 24 hour channeling solution would: Improve quality of life for gotchi owners,

* Mitigate unfavorable interaction times,
* Mitigate network congestion at interaction time, and,
* Increase daily engagement for time-poor players.

*RISKS*

Proposal implementation date may be delayed if Pixelcraft encounters technical challenges or is otherwise unable to meet the May 18, 2022 implementation date.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/giving-gotchi-owners-the-ability-to-reduce-cooldown-time-for-solo-channeling/3107).

Option 1: Yes, once per 24h window

### Scheduling Land Auction/Raffle #3 for June
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #30**

**Proposal Summary:**

Land Auction/Raffle #3 Proposal:

* Hold the Auction and Raffle within June
* 8,000 Parcels in total from predominantly districts 1, 6, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26. Parcels from previously auctioned/raffled districts are also included. The exact selection can be seen in the Discussion Thread: [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-for-land-auction-raffle-3-within-1-week-of-citaadel-release/3487/36](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-for-land-auction-raffle-3-within-1-week-of-citaadel-release/3487/36)
* 70% (5,600) of parcels in the auction, 30% (2,400) in the raffle

Proposed Revenue Distribution:

* 40% of Revenue to the Rarity Farming Rewards Pool
* 40% to Pixelcraft Studios
* 20% to the AavegotchiDAO
* 0% Burn

This proposal is synthesized from community feedback over the last few weeks and attempts to balance the following: NFT dilution; an auction/raffle feeling too rushed; inadequate available GHST liquidity; concern for the funding of Rarity Farming Season 4; capitalizing on the momentum and marketing of the full game release. A June Auction will allow >2 weeks of Citaadel gameplay and will allow sufficient time for marketing and business development efforts to capture maximum investment. There is an adequate Gotchiverse Rewards Pool after the first two land auctions, and this sale will help fund RFS4 and perhaps even some of Season 5.

This proposal has been discussed with the Pixelcraft team who support it and feel the target date is feasible.

### Launch of RF Szn 4
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #31**

**Proposal Summary:**

In line with the core prop passed via governance on Feb 15th, I’d like to take this moment to formalise the start of rarity farm S4 with the gotchi-DAO.

Since no major changes to the BRS, XP or kinship systems have occurred since the last season and since the passing of the proposal, I suggest we keep parameters equal to what they were for S3.

Following that, this would be the final model for SZN4:

4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the land sale of AGIP-30.

* 70% BRS

* 20% Kinship

* 10% XP

* Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)

In the event where the land sale of AGIP-30 does not lead to a RF pool of 1.5m GHST or higher, I suggest we make the rest of the 1.5m GHST prize pool whole via the DAO treasury as previously discussed in AGIP-23.

The DAO is potentially going to get rebalanced with a lot of GHST due to a recent Pixelcraft-lead proposal for a DAI buyback that might pass governance in the near future, so it would tie in handily to that.

In case you missed it, a short recap for our RF scheduling;

SZN 4 (covered in this core prop): June - July

SZN 5: October - November

SZN 6: February - March 2023

### Use DYST voting Power to Support vQi-Qi on Dystopia
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #32**

**Proposal Summary:**

The Aavegotchi DAO should use its DYST voting power to support the vQi-Qi pool on DystopiaSwap indefinitely. Any community member can submit an additional signal prop should reallocation be considered.. Indefinite support will avoid overly frequent Sig Prop submissions that are only tangentially related to the Aavegotchi DAO.

*Background:*

Dystopia Swap is an automated market maker with ve(3,3) mechanics which was recently launched on Polygon. They airdropped a big portion of their initial token supply to Polygon dApps including the Aavegotchi protocol, QiDAO, and the GotchiVault. This voting token is used to allocate scheduled rewards similar to QiDAO’s Qi. This means it is up to our Aavegotchi community to decide how to best use our airdropped voting power to support the DeFi aspect for Aavegotchi and GHST. I propose that this voting power be used to support the vQi-Qi pool which secures liquidity and rewards for the ~4M GHST in the vGHST protocol.

A brief overview of why this is good for GHST:

1. GHST users deposit their GHST for vGHST using the GotchiVault (3.83M vGHST exist currently)

2. vGHST can be deposited in QiDAO as collateral for borrowing MAI

3. Qi rewards are paid to borrowers based on a biweekly vote by Qi holders

4. Qi that is staked for 4 years has 4x the voting power- this is known as eQi. vQi is a liquid form of eQi that allows holders to sell the token. vQi voting power is always used for vGHST. 5. The current vQi supply is 833k which means 3.3M eQi voting power.

6. The system requires adequate vQi-Qi liquidity to be sustainable. This vote incentivizes the vQi-Qi pool which will deepen liquidity and create a flywheel effect in increasing vGHST rewards on QiDAO.

7. More rewards for vGHST means more rewards in the hands of the Aavegotchi community

None of the other pools directly benefit GHST holders which is why only vQi-Qi is included in this SigProp (https://www.dystopia.exchange/vote).

Thank you for your support as the GotchiVault runs with the DeFi aspect of our DeFi RPG, seeks to add value to GHST, and solidifies Aavegotchi’s position as a cornerstone of Polygon DeFi and gaming.

### Change Harvester Recipes
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #33**

**Proposal Summary:**

The original harvester recipes:

* Discourage upgrading parcels beyond levels 3 & 4.

* Are too expensive in cost and punishing in yields at the higher levels.

* Easily allow for the Low Leveloor to extract insanely high yields with very little investment.

* Are too inexpensive from a time-to-build perspective. This diminishes the effectiveness of makers and the utility of GLTR.

After a month and a half of theorising, simulating, and refining MikeyJay, coderdan, letsgobankless, and myself have arrived at a final recipe which we believe best solves the above problem.

The proposed recipe changes to the harvester:

* Promote dynamic gameplay with a multitude of winning strategies

* Make high level harvesters not only viable, but desirable

* Reduces inflation of alchemica

* Handicap the Low Leveloor strategySignificantly increase build time for each installation which promote a healthy GLTR economy. This increase drives more utility to the maaker.

This topic has been discussed at length. For a full understanding, I highly encourage you to read through the [forum thread](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/something-aint-right-with-installation-upgrades-resolved-and-in-progress/3715), [simulation results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WB8L6aEPEdGnEgxcRUD3ysRwko2fjzMU), and recipe changes. The [Bot Strategy](https://github.com/mikey-jay/realm-simulator#readme) provides insight into how the simulation bots operated.

*Associated Risks*

Given the amount of time invested in recreating this recipe, there are few contingencies.

The reduction in alchemica inflation also means a reduced ROI (in terms of alchemica, not necessarily $$$)

### AavegotchiDAO <> Pixelcraft Studios 1.75M DAI Token Swap
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #34**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Summary*

This proposal aims to swap 1.75 million DAI from AavegotchiDAO’s treasury with an equal value of GHST from Pixelcraft Studios’ balance sheet.

*Rationale*

The launch of the Gotchiverse has introduced new and increasing infra costs for Pixelcraft Studios that cannot be paid for in GHST (or any crypto for that matter). These costs primarily consist of usage of AWS and Redis Enterprise for real-time gameplay in the Gotchiverse, and will continue to scale up as the game gets more popular.

To pay for these costs, we have outlined several options:

* Raise funding from VCs

* Liquidate GHST into DAI and swap for fiat

* Use GHST as collateral on Aave to take loans in DAI

* Perform a token swap with AavegotchiDAO

We believe Option 4 (Token Swap) is the best available option at the moment. We strongly value our independence from VCs, prefer not to have debt on our balance sheet, and do not want to market sell GHST acquired from sales.

Therefore, we propose a token swap between AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios to ensure adequate fiat runway for several years of further development, no matter how bearish the market becomes.

*Key Details*

At the time of this writing, AavegotchiDAO treasury holds roughly:

* 2.5 Million DAI

* 3.5 Million GHST

* 3 Million Alchemica (Live source here: [AavegotchiDAO Treasury Balance](https://app.aavegotchi.com/treasury))

Pixelcraft Studios, on the other hand, is heavily skewed toward GHST with over 6.7 Million GHST in our primary revenue wallet while our only DAI is coming from [the curve’s monthly 150k DAI faucet](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-before-you-move-to-matic-stop-over-at-aavegotchidao-cb394134f357), 50k of which is already earmarked for GHST purchases.

Pixelcraft Studios has been able to effectively grow the team and support infrastructure costs without needing to liquidate any significant amount of GHST. But last month’s launch of the Gotchiverse and anticipated continued growth has pushed operating costs dramatically higher. Server costs for the April playdrop, for example, exceeded 40k USD, and that is projected to grow in the months ahead.

Such operating expenses are anticipated but we have to acknowledge that these subscriptions and invoices almost always insist on trad banking (fiat). We would prefer to not have to sell GHST in order to achieve the necessary growth budget.

The DAO’s revenue from the GHST bonding curve opens up the possibility of a large-scale exchange of assets between our two parties. With the game live, GHST off its all time highs, and a DAO treasury that is well established, we believe this is the right time to propose an OTC token swap.

For the purposes of this token swap, a valuation for GHST that all can agree on must be established. There are many ways to arrive at such, so in the interest of expediency, I am proposing an intuitive method that also tips the scale generously in the DAO’s direction:

*GHST valuation methodology*

Pixelcraft Studios has calculated GHST’s average price from Tuesday, June 14 to Saturday, June 18 (duration of the SigProp via CoinGecko) with a 5% discount applied to the final price: USD 1.28. If DAO voters find the results agreeable, they may vote to approve this CoreProp.

*Execution*

If the CoreProp passes, the token swap should process in a predictable way. I suggest the token swap occur with the following method of execution:

* Pixelcraft Studios shall first transfer the agreed upon amount of GHST (defined in the CoreProp) to the AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet.

* AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet (currently managed via multisig by Pixelcraft team) shall transfer 1.75 million DAI within 8 hours of receiving the GHST to the Pixelcraft Studios primary revenue wallet.

* Pixelcraft Studios shall make an announcement in Aavegotchi Discord confirming the reception of the DAI, thus concluding the token swap.

Option 1: Yes, perform a swap of 1.75M DAI

Option 2: No, don't perform a token swap

### Delay the 3rd LAND Auction
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #35**

**Proposal Summary:**

We are fast approaching the end of June when the LAND 3 auction/raffle is scheduled for based on the AGIP-30 core prop. However, since this core prop was started (20th May) a lot of things have changed:

* Harvester release has been delayed

* We are in the middle of a bloodbath in the markets

* LAND prices have dropped 30-70%

* LAND bazaar volume has dropped 90%

* There's been huge selling pressure on alchemica prices

Due to these significant changes in the market, its seems right to allow the DAO to have another emergency vote on whether to go ahead with the LAND auction or not as releasing an auction in this market is very likely to drive down assets prices across the ecosystem.

Coderdan confirmed it is viable to stop the auction but we must act quickly frens:

My thoughts are that it's generally not ideal to do a token sale in the middle of a market bloodbath as we are currently experiencing. Assets from all sectors of crypto are down, not just Aavegotchi. We are actually holding fairly strong in comparison.

However, the DAO has voted to do this sale, and it passed overwhelmingly, so the DAO will also need to vote to delay it."

Option 1: Yes, delay LAND 3 Release

### Utilizing the Channeling “Hot Zone”
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #36**

**Proposal Summary:**

There has been a lot of heated discussion about bots, scholars, spillover and more. A lot of it completely misses the point though, at least in my opinion. I went more in-depth on why I don't believe botting to be the primary problem at the moment in a comment [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/keeping-the-status-quo-of-disabled-spillover-for-a-while/3845/172).

So I started playing around with the numbers for spillover radius & rate, but I just couldn't find a satisfying solution. Reducing them only by a bit would barely have an effect, while reducing them drastically would devalue high level Aaltars. When I went through the blog post on channeling radius it finally clicked though! The mechanic was right there, just not utilized to its full potential (or at all really): The Hot Zone.

It became obvious pretty quickly that the Hot Zone wasn't so hot after all. The name simply implied that statistically speaking, 10% of the spillover would spawn inside of the inner 10% radius, 20% inside of the inner 20%, etc. This results in a slightly higher drop rate closer to the parcel, but in reality it barely makes a difference (only a single digit % of all spillover spawns in the "Hot Zone"). I want to propose allocating a fixed % of the spilled Alchemica based on Aaltar level.

Combined with a proposed radius of 60 Gotchis (compared to the 64x32 measurements of a Spacious), dropping a larger amount of Alchemica inside of the Hot Zone would suddenly make spillover feel much more like actual spillover instead of a random token drop around the map.

Imo this would:

* Create an interesting mechanic around the concept of spillover (as seen in the OG trailer)

* Add an incentive for players to pick up their spilled tokens instead of channeling & logging off (and writing off the spillover completely)

* Reduce the advantage of bots, since picking up spillover becomes less of a grinding & more of a channeling mechanic

* Overall make the Gotchiverse in its current form more interesting

Lastly, I would like to note one thing. This proposal suggests introducing the Hot Zone mechanic as soon as spillover is resumed. However, the reverse is not the case. This proposal is not a vote to turn spillover back on, I merely believe it to be one piece in the larger puzzle.

### Configure VP for amGHST, wapGHST, and all GLTR Staking
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #37**

**Proposal Summary:**

As we have now launched GLTR staking and most of us have moved our liquidity from the FRENS pools to the GLTR pools, it is time to make those pools officially part of the voting power.

The VP would be as follows, which is simply a continuation of how we have done everything on the FRENS staking side-

The affected pairs and tokens to be added, are as follows -

* amGHST(GHST staked on Aave)

* wapGHST (unstaked, staked on FRENS side, or staked on GLTR side)

* stkGHST-USDC (not added on GLTR side yet)

* stkGHST-MATIC (not added on GLTR side yet)

* stkGHST-GLTR

* stkGHST-FUD

* stkGHST-FOMO

* stkGHST-ALPHA

* stkGHST-KEK

VP is calculated as follows -

* amGHST, wapGHST - 1 VP per token

* All supported pairs that receive GLTR rewards - 1 VP per GHST staked, calculated at time of Snapshot. Again, this is simply a continuation of how we have treated GHST and staking in the past.

### Stop new BRS Wearable Emissions until further notice
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #38**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Problem*

Over the lifespan of Aavegotchi, we've endured many wearable dilution events which have negatively impacted our community by:

* Loss of investor confidence (and investors)

* Depreciation of asset values

* No known schedule for releases, resulting in uncertainty in the markets

* In bullish conditions, new wearables would be released, capping our upside growth

It makes sense to have a wearables budget. Something the whole community can see and investors can easily digest. A cap based on total live gotchis was proposed, but in truth it does not accurately depict the true usage of assets.

The community by and large agrees on a budget, however at this moment in time, we don't have the metrics or data to create one. This budget is likely going to come from data such as daily active users (once PvP is live).

*Proposal*

This proposal is simple and straightforward:

1. No new BRS-based wearables until the DAO votes on a budget

2. That budget will be developed at a later date once the data is available

The idea is to restore investor confidence and allow us to sleep a bit easier at night, knowing that our assets will not suffer from spontaneous dilution.

Note: this proposal does not include aesthetic wearables, new set creations, or set rebalances (such as Link Marine)

*Associated Risks*

I don't see any potential risks for this proposal.

### Modifying the Channeling Window
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #39**

**Proposal Summary:**

After trying out the 24 hour channeling window, many people were displeased with the results that it achieved.

Issues with the current system include extra server load from Midnight to 1 UTC, the creation of a "prime time" where there is a short window of time where most alchemica is spilled, and problems caused by needing to channel a gotchi before putting it on the market(we do not have the full action control lists yet).

The goal of this sig prop, is to give quality of life improvements to Gotchi owners with creating an exploitable mechanic or causing undue server loads or other issues.

The proposed solutions are to either to A) revert to the original implementation, as presented in the Gotchiverse Bible, B) Leave the system as is and let the issues resolve themselves over time, or C) Keep the current system, but add a feature that lets you burn glitter to move your gotchi(s) channeling window reset time forward by one block, per glitter spent.

The implementation, would be that we are given a way to adjust one or all gotchis channeling window, by spending GLTR to move the window forward one block per GLTR spent. It will only be possible to move the time forward, and you can only do this, if the gotchi(s) are currently able to channel.

The risks associated with this are that there will be unintended consequences, as always.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/giving-gotchi-owners-the-ability-to-reduce-cooldown-time-for-solo-channeling/3107)

Option 1: Revert to the original solution

### Sunsetting FRENS Immediately
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #40**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose that we cease FRENS emissions immediately. FRENS emissions have been used as a liquidity mining (LM) incentive by providing GHST holders and liquidity providers access to future content through the raffle system. While this was an initially effective tool for LM, it is now doing more harm than good. Outlined below and in the forum thread are the reasons why Aavegotchi should sunset FRENS:

* Eliminating FRENS will reduce Aaveogotchi protocol pressure to hold dilutional events by eliminating ongoing “content debt” created by FRENS emissions

* GHST has alternative staking utility with GLTR liquidity mining

* Shifting focus to alchemica/GLTR pairs reallocates LM rewards to asset holders who are more directly providing value to the ecosystem in the form of liquidity vs single-sided GHST staking which provides limited and historically overcompensated value

* Future content events can generate protocol revenue instead of paying out content debt. This allows for a more sustainable revenue stream for Pixelcraft and the Aavegotchi DAO

* The value of future content can be captured on-chain with GLTR/Alchemica/GHST instead of off-chain with FRENS

* Capturing on-chain value of the above native assets will significantly add utility to all tokens

* Current FRENS and raffle ticket holders must be acknowledged with raffle(s). There are multiple avenues for this which are outlined in the DAO forum thread. The community can design and publicize events to utilize these FRENS which will be an easier task if we stop further emissions and narrow the scope of the raffle with cessation of FRENS’ emissions.

There will be an additional signal proposal outlining changes to GLTR emissions to support liquidity provision for the GHST token specifically. While the bonding curve is in place, it is important that a sustainable GHST liquidity plan is in place that captures and rewards LPs fairly and sustainably.

### Update GLTR Emissions
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #41**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose that we alter GLTR emissions to optimize GHST liquidity and support the sunsetting of FRENS as outlined in the “Sunset FRENS" proposal.

The above proposal and this one will accomplish the following:

* Retire the GHST-QUICK liquidity pool liquidity mining rewards (currently FRENS)

* Retire the GHST-WETH liquidity pool mining rewards (currently FRENS)

* Retire the GHST-MATIC liquidity pool mining rewards (currently FRENS + GLTR)

* Add 5% weight to the GHST-USDC LM rewards (taken from GHST-MATIC) for a total of 20%

* This consolidation will maximize our most successful pool in GHST-USDC. It will eliminate rewards for unpopular pools and help grow our most successful pool. The GHST-WETH pair was borne from the Dinoswap pool which is a failed project. The GHST-MATIC pair is the only one on SushiSwap which is an inactive exchange on Polygon. Neither project offers ongoing LM incentives. The increase in GHST-USDC LM rewards is necessary to offer compensation for the impermanent loss risk incurred by the pair, otherwise single-sided staking for wapGHST will be prioritized and not afford further depth in the GHST-USDC pool. Below is the chart with highlighted changes to GLTR emissions and resultant estimated APYs.

Option 1: Yes. Increase USDC remove MATIC.

Option 2: No. Leave emissions unchanged.

### Setting limits on the number of borrowed gotchis allowed per wallet address
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #42**

**Proposal Summary:**

Until recently there have been no limits on the number of gotchis an address can borrow at the same time, either from a whitelist or from the open (non whitelisted) market.

This was recently changed to a limit of 1 borrowed gotchi on the open market and 1 by default on all whitelists. A whitelist owner can change the number of allowed borrowed gotchis per address using Louper Dev, and soon, through the official UI.

This change was put in place with no warning as an experiment in anti botting measures. Community members had reported difficulty in securing a gotchi to borrow for channelling, particularly around the 0:00UTC reset time, which has been attributed to bots scraping all the best rental offers before humans get a chance.

The change has so far seen Gotchigang report an increase in available gotchis to borrow around reset time which is a positive.

On the negative side, other Gotchigang have reported being unable to fully channel their aaltars due to not being able to rent enough gotchis. This is particularly for borrowers who’ve paid, say, 20ghst for a long term rental and are now stuck with that 1 gotchi and are unable to channel other parcels using other borrowed gotchis. This issue will tend to grow over time as people level up their aaltars and generate more channelling opportunities. The current limit on the open market is a disincentive to levelling up aaltars and purchasing more land for those without enough gotchis who prefer longer term rentals. It could also severely limit the demand for lending out gotchis long term, however it forces people to approach multiple guilds/whitelist owners for spots which is a positive for the social element of the game.

A poll was run in the weekly DAO Hangout by CoderDan with the results suggesting most community members would prefer the allowed number of borrowed gotchis on the open market to reflect the number of parcels a wallet address holds plus 1, so in theory each parcel could be channelled once per day whilst still holding longer term rentals. For single channel rentals this is less of a concern as people can return a gotchi and borrow another as soon as they’ve finished using it.

Further increasing the borrowing limit up to the number of available channellings per address was suggested by considering aaltar levels as well, but it was deemed too inefficient to be constantly recalculating this number dynamically in the background.

As this was an experiment, I propose we revert these changes back now and continue to monitor the impacts so we can be clearer on the severity of the botting issue and be more confident in the effectiveness of this solution, whilst voting to implement the below.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reform-public-rental-market/4089)

Option 1: Limit market to # of parcels + 1

Option 2: Keep original unlimited system

Option 3: Unlimited open, limit whitelists

### Add DAO Liquidity to GHST-Alchemica Pairs
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #43**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose that the Aavegotchi DAO add 50,000 GHST + matching alchemica liquidity to the GHST-Alchemica pairs. Further, I propose that we do not stake corresponding LP tokens for GLTR.

The benefits of adding liquidity are multiple:

* Allows for lower slippage trading which will attract more trading and investment

* Legitimizes the Aavegotchi ecosystem, its farming, and the native tokens

* Supports land investors and, more specifically, those actively farming their land

* Allows the DAO to earn trading fees on the liquidity provided

There are also some risks which should be considered:

* Impermanent loss may decrease the net dollar value of DAO treasury funds

* Asks a difficult question of whether or not to stake LP tokens for GLTR and compete directly against community stakers for rewards

* Paying for liquidity is an expense in our ecosystem. In the long term, revenue must outweigh expenses for the Aavegotchi economy to thrive and assets to gain value. We should seriously consider our expenses vs revenues moving forward as we incentivize liquidity, hence the recent passed proposal to terminate FRENS which will both decrease expenses and allow NFT distributions to generate revenues

There is currently only $732,000 TOTAL in liquidity among the four alchemica-GHST pairs. Anything above a 1500 GHST swap has a price impact >1% which is not acceptable for a GameFi blue chip looking to instill investor confidence and attract new, large builders. Let’s bolster liquidity now and develop a sustainable and predictable plan to continue to add DAO liquidity at an, ideally, expense neutral rate. We can partner with the incoming DAO Project Manager(s) and community bounty hunters to further define DAO revenues and expenses to formulate our liquidity plan.

### Mint and Transfer 50 DAO Parcels and 4M FUD Eq. of Alchemica to the DTF for Contributor Compensation
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #44**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose that 50 DAO parcels from district 30 be minted and sent to the DTF multisig in addition to 4M FUD Equivalents worth of alchemica.

This will allow us to leverage DAO assets other than GHST to compensate our contributors. We have a variety of assets as a protocol, some of which have considerable goodwill value such as parcels in the DAO district. We can leverage these assets to better compensate and acknowledge past, current, and prospective contributors. Parallel to this effort, a transparent, stepwise process towards earning a DAO parcel will be designed. Potential pros of using alchemica/minted NFT displays/parcels as compensation:

* Gives the DAO more options in reimbursing contributors

* Leverages assets outside of GHST

* Develops and promotes a contributor/builder culture specifically inside the gotchiverse

* May have potential cascade effect where contributors build and develop their earned parcels, keeping assets within the ecosystem

* Fosters building and development in the DAO district which should hopefully be a spotlight of activity in the gotchiverse.

An example of contributor compensation would be a DAO parcel with a LE NFT display and custom NFT – an incredibly meaningful and valuable token of appreciation for DAO contributions.

The specific parcels will be defined in the core proposition if this signal proposition passes. Feedback and ideas on specific parcel allocation is appreciated and should be directed to the included DAO discourse thread above. If the DTF is absorbed by the new DAO structure, the parcels and alchemica can be sent to the same multisig holding the DTF budget funds.

### Preventing Owners From Channeling Gotchis Listed For Lending
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #45**

**Proposal Summary:**

The idea here is fairly simple. To prevent gotchi owners from channeling their gotchis while they are listed for rent on the aavegotchi site. The reason for this is that we saw at least a few instances of owners listing their gotchis for rent then immediately after channeling. What would happen was that an unexpecting player would check the rental market after the gotchi was rented but before it got channeled and would then be stuck renting a channeled gotchi. The owner would get the channeling alchemica as well as the rental fees from the borrower.

This hasn’t been a widespread issue yet because not many people are maliciously doing it, it also needs to be timed well with someone checking the rental market at the wrong moment. But I don’t believe there is any benefit to allowing owners the ability to make use of this exploit.

As per Dan on the thread, the implementation is ready so it won’t require anymore dev time, there just happened to be some minor pushback on this idea so the devs don’t want to implement it without a vote.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/preventing-gotchis-listed-for-rental-from-being-able-to-channel/4388)

### Creating New Wearable Sets
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #46**

**Proposal Summary:**

During the new wearables moratorium, the opportunities to fix existing sets and to introduce new sets involving ONLY current wearables were identified.

The "broken" sets were successfully fixed via patch, and different members of the community put forth their suggestions for new wearable sets. Existing Pixelcraft guidelines for the composition and bonuses of each wearable set, mainly based on the rarity of the highest component, were applied.

In the referenced forum link, polls were established for all members of the community to be able to express their support for a particular set.

The spreadsheet with details for all proposed sets is available at: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174ea8dzcO3yiBOgCvAIdUuQkK5_AHG3FoZdMunAJZYY](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174ea8dzcO3yiBOgCvAIdUuQkK5_AHG3FoZdMunAJZYY)

The ideation Discord thread where the ideas for the sets were brainstormed can be referenced at: [https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/992288286271864832/1002569658634862602](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/992288286271864832/1002569658634862602)

It was decided by consensus that Pixelcraft would retain ultimate veto and decision power in the ultimate implementation of these sets. At large, this effort has been also a means to share with the broader Aavegotchi DAO public how the process has previously worked between WTF and Pixelcraft i.e. a volunteer-dependent process, that nonetheless can achieve great things for the ecosystem by harnessing the different talents and creativity of all of our frens.

### Enacting a Bonding Curve Emergency Plan
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #47**

**Proposal Summary:**

 There is a lot of uncertainty concerning the regulation of decentralized smart contracts (Tornado Cash) and stablecoins. Since GHST is closely tied to DAI's value, we need to monitor those developments very closely. If anything happens to DAI, our entire treasury (and GHST's stability) is at risk.

In this proposal I want to define the potential cases of emergency and the actions the multisig currently managing the GHST Bonding Curve on Ethereum mainnet needs to take to mitigate risks. Again, as long as DAI works as intended, this proposal does not suggest messing with the Curve - that is a completely separate discussion.

*Emergency Scenarios*

1. DAI loses dollar peg: As long as USDC backing is intact, no action needed. Signers should however set alerts for $0.95 and $0.90 to be notified of a potential depeg so they're able to act immediately as the situation unrolls.
2. MakerDAO shifts away from a dollar backing: Very long-term strategic consideration, will probably take 2-3 years to unfold. No immediate action needed, more relevant for the discussion surrounding a general Curve shutdown.
3. This is the important one. MakerDAO contracts get blacklisted by Circle (USDC) due to regulatory reasons: Signers would have to act immediately to protect the value of GHST's backing. I propose immediately shutting down the Curve and swapping the DAI for USDC. This ensures that we lock in some of our treasury's value, it does however remove the main source of liquidity for GHST. To make sure GHST doesn't enter a free fall, $5M worth of USDC should immediately be paired with $5M worth of treasury GHST in our main Quickswap pool.

Using the current numbers, this would leave us with ~$18M USDC - the majority of which should be used to buy back the paired GHST and build up a larger LP position. The initial LP position would double our current pool and buy enough time to decide on next steps.

Keep in mind that this is a very unlikely emergency scenario. We should be prepared for everything though, getting caught with our pants down could wipe out a large sum of our treasury value and put GHST in a very vulnerable position.

### The Forge - Request for Funding and Development
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #48**

**Proposal Summary:**

Introducing the Forge:

TL;DR

* You can turn wearables into other wearables with the forge mechanic

* Wearables are made of alloys + schematics (the recipe) + Frames

* This allows many new wearable designs

* This process can be deflationary, making room for new wearable sales and protecting current asset value

* This 50,000 GHST will go to fund the development of the Forge, its mechanics, smart contracts, art, and educational materials

* The goal is for the DAO to do as much of the work as possible to avoid delaying Pixelcraft’s other efforts

* See the Project Overview and Google Sheet documents for extensive details

* Know that this is all a work in progress and we would all benefit from broad DAO contributions

*Budget Request and Purpose:*

50k GHST to pay for development of smart contract work, economics team, project management, art bounties, dashboard bounties, and event/rewards for launch

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432)

Option 1: Yes, fund the Project 50k GHST

### Adjust Aaltar Spillover Rates
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #49**

**Proposal Summary:**

There's been a lot of debate in the DAO this week around alchemica inflation. It's clear that our economy cannot handle the amount of tokens being currently issued. Therefore, we have come up with a proposal to increase spillover rate in lower level aaltars to help reduce the amount of alchemica being issued and encourage frens to upgrade their aaltars. We believe this will stabilize the economy until more alchemica sinks are introduced in the eagerly anticipated combat release.

The table in the Discourse thread shows the Daily FUD inflation rate caused by chanelling, broken down by aaltar level. You can see the current inflation levels and spillover rates, our new proposed spillover rates and the reduction in inflation this will cause.

We believe these measures are necessary given current economic conditions but we are always free as a DAO to change them at a later date in light of new information or more alchemica sinks being introduced.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/alternative-alchemica-economic-plan/4490)

Option 1: Change to Proposed Aaltar Rates

Option 2: Do Nothing

### Create AavegotchiDAO Foundation
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #50**

**Proposal Summary:**

AavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST bonding curve. Since then, the DAO has matured into one of the world’s most active with over forty successful AGIPs passed and extremely healthy metrics on Snapshot. Over this period we also graduated across our DAO’s roadmap, going from DAO 1.0 into the more experimental period known as Cocoon, our precursor to Metamorphosis (AKA DAO 2.0). Achieving Metamorphosis requires the DAO to further decentralize and accept more responsibilities currently guarded by the original summoners and Pixelcraft Studios.

Today we propose the next major step forward by suggesting it is time for AavegotchiDAO to add an off-chain presence to our decentralized autonomous organization. The following proposal is rooted in months of research and interfacing with a variety of legal advisors. We also take the practices of leading peers such as ENS and Sushi into consideration, opting for Foundation formation in the Cayman Islands coupled with on-chain governance being secured as primary via the Foundation’s Constitution.

My proposal is for us to form the AavegotchiDAO Foundation in the Cayman Islands as soon as possible by following these steps:

* Gather all interested in serving as one of nine Directors on the Foundation. These nine Directors simultaneously are seated on the Foundation’s newly formed multisig wallet. All serving must be KYC’d.

* Host election via Snapshot where the nine most voted for shall serve as Directors of the Foundation until further notice (The DAO should likely flesh out details for term length etc with a separate AGIP at a later date). The election shall happen in parallel to this proposal’s CoreProp.

* Submit the nine fully KYC’d Directors details to our legal counsel from LEX DAO so that they can immediately begin Foundation formation. This will be completed in days, not weeks.

* Upon formation of the Foundation, the Directors shall create the new Foundation’s primary multisig using Gnosis.

* Pixelcraft Studios shall transfer DAO Treasury multisig funds to the Foundation multisig, including DAI, GHST, and Alchemica on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.

* The Foundation is thus formed, ready to execute transactions according to the will of AavegotchiDAO. Further definitions of responsibilities, scope, goals and limits can be defined by the DAO at a later date.

**FOUNDATION DETAILS**

*Entity*

* A Cayman Islands foundation with a board consisting of 9 Directors, who are also the multisig signers of the DAO Treasury wallet.

* Legal Counsel shall arrange a local officer to act as secretary fulfilling basic administrative requirements until further notice.

* Legal Counsel shall arrange a local corporate secretarial service to assist with Foundation formation, documentation and production of financial statements.

*DAO Treasury*

* All DAO treasury funds present and future shall be transferred to the Board’s multisig.

* The GHST Bonding Curve Council tokens could potentially also be transferred to the multisig signers, via a new AGIP proposal.

* Eventually, all protocol contracts could be owned by this multisig, or if that is deemed not ideal, could be owned by the DAO itself (onchain voting) with the Board multisig action as a last resort Guardian to prevent malicious transactions.

*Bank Account*

Upon formation of the Foundation, legal counsel will confer with our corporate secretary to establish a Cayman Island’s bank account on the Foundation’s behalf. While not immediately useful, we have requested that this bank account be opened so as to futureproof the DAO to be able to natively settle any off-chain expenses (tradfi subscription fees, service providers, etc).

*Board of Directors*

Consists of nine doxxed Directors that also act as multisig signers on the DAO Treasury multisig. The DAO Treasury multisig shall be set at 5/9 signers in order to execute.

Paid position starting at 8000 GHST per year, paying 2000 GHST to each Directory directly from the Treasury multisig every 90 days.

The Board acts as the executor of the DAO’s wishes. If individual Directors disagree with an action of the DAO, they can choose to resign but they cannot vote or act against a verified on-chain AGIP’s intent.

Candidates should:

* Be upstanding members of AavegotchiDAO with good reputations

* Be familiar with smart contract interactions

* Possess a hardware wallet and know how to use it

* Be willing to have your name on a Cayman entity and be doxxed to Pixelcraft Studios

* (Nice to have) Be familiar with creating transactions and signing on Gnosis Safe

*The Officer*

The Foundation also requires at least one Officer to serve an official capacity for signing off-chain documentation. Legal offers a package to deliver one local Officer to fulfill this role. This is not a role for advocacy so this Officer will simply execute signatures at the direction of the Directors. Of course, AavegotchiDAO can always revisit or even expand Officer roles at any point.

*The Constitution*

Legal Counsel will draft and supply a first version of a Constitution that takes best practices from fellow DAOs into consideration. Counsel will submit this Constitution in the form of a commentable Google Sheet for our community to give feedback and suggest changes.

Counsel and the DAO shall go back and forth in up to three drafts before the Constitution is sent to Snapshot for a three-day CoreProp regarding ratification.

If ratification fails, another two drafts shall be edited before re-submitting for another CoreProp vote. This process continues until a ratification of the Constitution is achieved.

Due to the critical nature of this CoreProp and the fact that it skips the SigProp step, the CoreProp vote shall require a voting result with those in approval at 66% or greater.

*Benefits of Formation*

* Independence; greater separation of Pixelcraft Studios from AavegotchiDAO

* Board can execute proposals on behalf of the DAO (Liquidity provision, GHST staking, funding Dework, etc.)

*Risks of Formation*

* More responsibility on AavegotchiDAO governance

* More exposure to any future policy shifts specifically in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction

### Rarity Farming Season 5
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #52**

**Proposal Summary:**

Gm frens,

I come to you bearing the anticipated S5 sigprop!

In the spirit of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”, I propose we keep things business as usual, since I believe our community has been having a bit of "change fatigue" of late - please refresh yourselves on the params of the past four seasons below:

4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury:

* 70% BRS

* 20% Kinship

* 10% XP

Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)

Ideal launch period in the mind of the author: after the deployment of The Forge, or January 2023, whichever comes first.

Thank you as always for your consideration and your votes.

Stay spooky frens!

Changes from Sigprop:

The author has agreed that the next Rarity Farming Season should come after the deployment of The Forge, or January 2023, whichever comes first.

The source of funds has been updated from Gotchiverse Player Rewards wallet to DAO treasury.

### Channel Alchemica by Burning Kinship
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #53**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose to charge -4 kinship each time gotchi is channelling the altar.

This change gives a gotchi a choice to:

(1) accumulate kinship (+2 kinship /day) and improve the character farming specs

(2) take alchemica now and lose on the yield multiplier

By implementing this elegant and relatively simple solution, we are not only changing the alchemica dynamics and cutting the efficient inflation by 50% (in the wild should be closer to 60/40 or 40/60, depending on market conditions), but also making a game more strategic and exciting for long term players.

Such change is an excellent alternative to the current economic proposals and additionally will reduce the MATIC spend for channelling in half.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/kinship-og-kinship-economical-proposal/4524)

Option 1: Implement original kinship mechanics

Option 2: Do not implement

### Creating the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF)
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #54**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Background*

This SigProp was previously created back in June 2022, the proposal did not meet the quorum at the time. This proposal is being re-created as there has been some traction on games developed by community members that would like to utilize player rewards acquired through AGIP16.

*Introduction*

The open-source nature of the Aavegotchi protocol combined with its on-chain assets provides an excellent foundation for external development efforts. More specifically, third-party developed games can greatly expand the usability of Aavegotchi assets and provide growth to the entire project.

*Problem*

Through AGIP 16, the DAO staked 100k GHST to generate rewards that could be given out to the wider Aavegotchi community of players for participating in mini-game events. To date, there has been minimal usage of these rewards. This is in part due to lack of:

* Clarity on how game developers can apply for (and be sent) player rewards for their game events,

* A game development focused task force that can help review applications for these player rewards, and,

* New games!!

*Solution*

This proposal aims to introduce and confirm the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF) who will:

* Control the multi-sig wallet that distributes player rewards to the community and developers,

* Review applications for player rewards to be used in developer games, and

* Provide a supportive platform for developers to discuss, troubleshoot and test their games in the ATF’s Aavegotchi Aarcade discord server.

*End Goal & Benefit*

The ATF’s objective is to help incentivize the development of more mini-games of a higher quality for the Aavegotchi community to play, share and enjoy. The natural benefit of this is increased utility and growth for the Aavegotchi protocol and its assets. By taking active custody of the 100k GHST from AGIP16, the ATF firmly believes it can help more player rewards get to the community and spur the next generation of Aavegotchi mini-games!

*Potential Risks*

As we are in the early stages of forming the Aarcade Task Force some potential risks include:

* Mismanagement, theft or loss of rewards (multi-sig wallet helps mitigate this),

* ATF members becoming inactive (signer numbers have been kept low to help ensure the multi-sig remains agile)

*Amendment to AGIP 16*

AGIP16 did not originally allow for usage of the 100k GHST to directly purchase assets from the Aavegotchi bazaar.

The ATF proposes that for successful stress test and xp/release game events, the following maximum drawdown amounts from the 100k GHST pool can be made (in agreeance with the game developer hosting an event) to purchase additional prizes from the Aavegotchi bazaar to be distributed to players:

* 100 GHST per stress test game event

* 500 GHST per xp/release game event

Note: Purchases will only be made via the Aavegotchi bazaar for maximum transparency.

*Fake Gotchi Cards (FGC’s)*

Frens generated by the AGIP16 100k GHST were used to enter the last raffle draw for Fake Gotchi Cards netting a total of 87 burn cards that are now available for use as mini-game player rewards. Under this proposal, these cards would also be transferred to the ATF multi-sig.

The ATF intends to allow one card be used per game event to mint a collection that can be distributed to players as the game developer of that event sees fit. A typical use case could be that 100 pieces of art are minted with one FGC and then distributed to the top 100 addresses in a game leaderboard event.

Note: Compensation for artists collaborating on FGC works will be from funding sources outside of the AGIP16 100k GHST (and its rewards pool) and is outside the ATF’s scope. It will be the game developers responsibility to negotiate terms with a collaborating artist.

*ATF Members*

There will be 7 initial signers for the ATF multi-sig wallet:

* jarrod | aavegotchistats.com#9686

* Gotchinomics#4936

* Slick#2526

* shah#0369

* PG#0811

* Scrooger

* Hefe

These members have all actively participated in the Aavegotchi community for over a year now, come from different backgrounds and consist of experienced developers, security experts and gamers:

Transactions will require 4 out 7 signers to approve before they can be processed.

The ATF multi-sig treasury wallet will be used to:

* Control distribution of rewards from AGIP16 100k GHST Staking,

* Convert GHST to and from wapGHST for GLTR staking, noting the following: The staked ratio to be managed at the ATF’s discretion, and, only the wapGHST pool will be used to stake for GLTR for now but will review this as the greater Aavegotchi protocol and DAO evolves

* Drawdown on 100K player rewards to purchase Aavegotchi NFT assets from the Baazaar to distribute as player rewards: Maximum of 100 GHST for each stress test event; Maximum of 500 GHST for each xp/release event

* Minting Fake Gotchi Card art work to be used as player rewards

*Conclusion*

So what do you think? Should we form the Aarcade Taask Force this time Anon?

### Update the Template to Require the Use of ‘Weighted Voting’
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #55**

**Proposal Summary:**

I'd like to propose that we update the template for proposals to require all future proposals to use the voting system 'weighted voting' (even for simple yes/no proposals). Weighted voting is what was used in the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election CoreProp.

*Effect:*

1. Using weighted voting, sub-DAOs like GotchiVault will be able to vote in a way that accurately reflects the outcomes of their sister proposals.

2. People will be able to show slight preferences, or even indifference, by splitting their own votes; even on yes/no proposals.

*Goals:*

1. A more accurate reflection of VP.

2. Lessen concerns about large sub-DAOs being able to determine a proposal's outcome by themselves. For example, when GotchiVault does not split it's vote, they basically pick the winning choice of any proposal that reaches a quorum of about 3M or more. By giving them the ability to fine-tune their VP to their sister-proposal's results, there would be less concerns from DAO members about large sub-DAOs accumulating VP.

*Risks:*

1. Even if we require the use of weighted voting for all future proposals, we can't force sub-DAOs to utilize it in a democratic way. They still might decide to put all their VP behind the winning choice of their sister proposal. While this is completely up to them, there is little downside for the DAO in giving them that choice (i.e. enabling them to split their votes more accurately).

2. Weighted voting might seem unfamiliar at first. However, we've recently utilized this voting system for the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election, and I have yet to see any complaints about the system being too complicated for people to use. The way that snapshot implemented it, is very intuitive, so 'weighted voting' being unfamiliar seems to be a negligible concern.

3. Could potentially increase uninformed voting. Having to make a choice is sometimes hard. Especially because snapshot allows anyone to check all your past votes. So one should feel a sense of responsibility when casting one's vote. Using weighted voting we could see some people splitting their vote equally for all available choices. While this could reflect true indifference, it could also be a way for people to get XP while avoiding responsibility for any outcome. So no reason to read up on what's going on, just split the vote and get XP. While this might seem like a valid concern, I don't believe it is. There are always some uninformed people voting with their guts. People who care enough about their reputation to vote 50/50 to avoid responsibility for their choice (instead of just picking one of the options), but don't care enough to read up on their choices and pick what they believe is the best option, are likely a negligible minority.

### Fund Alchemica Spending Competition
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #56**

**Proposal Summary:**

Hey frens,

This has been a long time in the works but we’re finally getting ready to launch the first Gotchiboard competition - Alchemica spending season 1.

This will be hosted on [https://gotchiboard.com/](https://gotchiboard.com/) - a DAO funded project

The competition will rank which addresses have spent the most alchemica. There will be 4 one-week rounds and a total of 80k GHST up for grabs!

Pixelcraft have already confirmed they will provide 25k GHST and this proposal is to fund a further 55k GHST from the Gotchiverse player rewards wallet.

Full details and rules can be found in the forum post.

The aims of the competition are:

* Incentivise Alchemica and GLTR spending to reduce the circulating supply before PvP

* Provide a fun gamified way for guilds and individuals to build their farms

* Have an entertaining and frenly competition for all to participate in or observe

Thank you for your support frens and look forward to battling it out in the competition.

### Establish the “Core Framework” Guiding Wearable Release
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #57**

**Proposal Summary:**

The Core Framework: A Proposal for Responsibly Managing Aavegotchi Wearables Emissions

Core Framework Written Summary: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTBNQqIVzvENiNmCL3kKAvgdKzcs4nWgyyVHvmX_ONQ/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTBNQqIVzvENiNmCL3kKAvgdKzcs4nWgyyVHvmX_ONQ/)

Core Framework Ratios, Calculations and Proposed Sale: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jk6O3zzsOIBmy1OwQlBsy0LWPQZrjxsWmlY2YCMz2iw/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jk6O3zzsOIBmy1OwQlBsy0LWPQZrjxsWmlY2YCMz2iw/)

These documents, prepared by The Forge Team, constitutes our recommended framework for the DAO to responsibly manage the future emissions of additional cores, and thus the increase of wearables supply.

The supply of cores, as defined in The Forge Litepaper, is the lever by which the protocol controls how many wearables can be forged on a rarity and slot basis. We are proposing three key ratios to be set by the DAO and used for managing the supply of cores in the future:

1. The ratio of total wearables to total gotchis. The Forge Team proposes an increase in the rate of wearables to gotchis from current state of 4.2/gotchi  to 4.3/gotchi (approximately 2.6% increase).

2. The ratio of each rarity tier to the total number of wearables. The Forge Team is not proposing any modifications to the ratios between rarity tiers.

3. The ratio of each wearable slot to the total number of wearables. The Forge Team recommends the following slot ratios:

table_slotRatios

We propose that the DAO should use the above key ratios to determine when to release additional cores, as well as how new cores should be distributed between rarities and slots. These ratios result in an initial addition of 2158 total cores across 15 different core types (out of 36 total).

The Core Framework will need to be maintained to include recent, relevant market data and evolutions in the market and the Aavegotchi protocol. Additional Core or Alloy sales must pass a core proposal outlining the specific sale and reasoning. If this Core Framework is accepted by the DAO, it will be included in a large Core Proposal to launch The Forge.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432)

Option 1: Yes, Accept the Core Framework

Option 2: No. Reject this Framework

### Launch Round 2 Parcel VRF Rolls
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #58**

**Proposal Summary:**

I propose that we implement the round 2 parcel roll by early February.

The  predominant discussions and farming emissions design specifically outlined a re-roll at 6 months. Many of the most invested and long-standing members of the Gotchiverse specifically designed their farming strategy around this shared understanding. Numerous DAO members helped contribute to the current recipes and mathematics specifically with that timetable in mind.

There are additional reasons to implement the round 2 rolls:

* We have an opportunity to meet our commitments as a DAO, even if the Gotchiverse deliverable of a great battle is not quite ready

* We can set a precedent for supporting asset holders and contributing members of our ecosystem

* We will encourage further investment from current community members and be a more attractive investment to newcomers if we establish a pattern of reliability

* Gotchiverse land owners have been especially harmed by macro market conditions and gotchiverse-specific market trends. This is one small effort to support those investing time and resources into the Gotchiverse

* We are pushing for a higher farming to channeling ratio of alchemica emissions which this would support

* It is more attractive to invest in the alchemica spending competition (and land in general) with a definitive round 2 plan

* It is a targeted nerf/rug to those most supporting the ecosystem to intentionally delay rerolls

* The hopeful time frame of an April Great Battle is also not definitive and susceptible to delays given the complexity of the current roadmap and desired focus on PVP

There are notable potential cons to consider:

* Increased overall alchemica emissions if invested farmers have round 2 alchemica to farm

* Mismatch of new rounds to the anticipated lore of a Great Battle followed by the new round

On the 1/8 DAO call, coderdan specifically stated it is a small dev lift to implement the next round of re-rolls, so this should not cause any major delays or change in shipping priorities. As thoroughly discussed in DAO discussion, both paths are reasonable, and I appreciate the formal DAO temperature check with this sig prop.

Details on the AGIP can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/second-round-vrf-rolls-for-parcels/4602)

Option 1: Yes. Launch Round 2 Parcel Roll

Option 2: No. Wait until the Great Battle

### 2023 DTF Budget Request
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #59**

**Proposal Summary:**

I am requesting a budget extension while the DAO discusses alternatives to the DTF model.

The request covers two projects which have delivered on their promises but remain partially funded. In hindsight, the funds allocated for a project should have been withheld to avoid making requests after the fact. We learn from this.

The DAO is discussing the assessment and funding of new projects. This process may take another 3-6 weeks till we reach consensus and implement a new funding model.

In the meantime, we should ensure DAO members and project sponsors who have already done work are made whole for their efforts.

Below are the completed projects, including an additional request to cover bounties for two months. My compensation has been removed and will be included in another proposal.

* Gotchi Farmy Sandbox Project; 8000/16000 GHST

* GotchiBoard by Mark; 1000/2000 GHST
* Media team Bounties 5000 GHST

The total request is 14,000 GHST. Funding will be sent to the current DTF multi-sig.

The DTF is not funding new Project Grants for 2023 until the DAO reaches a consensus on an improved funding process. This request is only to compensate members for completed work and to keep DAO operations going with bounties.

Appreciate contributions and efforts given towards Aavegotchi DAO & Project development so far.

### Gotchi Lodge 2023
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #60**

**Proposal Summary:**

Eth Denver 2023 kicks off on February 24th, running through March 5th. It represents the largest gathering of Web3 talent in the world. This year’s event presents an opportunity for Aavegotchi DAO to collaborate with Pixelcraft by sending a team to spread awareness of the Aavegotchi protocol to developers and interested parties at the conference.

The team will be led by Aavegotchi DAO member Hefe and some of our most active Aavegotchi members.

The attending team will be:

**Lost Local;** Pixelcraft Director of physical goods and events.

**Hefe;** Event lead, managing bounties, organisation

**NoFuturistic;** Media capture, editing

**Zombie Shepherd;** Partnerships, media capture, A/V

**Mycaleum;** Partnerships, marketing, support

**Smokescreens;** Marketing, support

**Lev;** Support

The team is coordinating efforts to represent Aavegotchi as a unit; collaborating by wearing weather-appropriate branded team gear, carrying physical merchandise such as stickers, boiling down concise explanations for specific target audiences, and distributing links to a landing page showcasing key features of the protocol and resources for builders.

One IRL meetup we are excited to host is an ebic coffee shop live-streamed discussion featuring interesting builders present at the event, advocates from venues, and existing partnership connections. We are calling this event #BuidlWithFrens. There will be merchandise giveaways and a custom FG card exclusive to the event, published by GMI. The event will be an opportunity to connect with new frens, and capture unique and interesting experiences from both the Hackathon, shilling zone, man-on-the-street interviews, as well as lecture workshops. The whole coffee shop event will be broadcasted via various streaming services, including Aavegotchi Discord for those who cannot attend.

An extensive media plan has been put together for ETH Denver featuring a diverse and varied array of content, notably a dual daily VLOG, as well as raw footage sent to both editors and the Pixelcraft marketing team for promotional videos. Media coverage will not only increase our presence at the event, but also give the Aavegotchi team multiple opportunities to create long-term connections with other interesting and informed attendees. The Gotchi Lodge(Air BNB) is close to the venue, making it easy to host interviews there as well.

Currently, lodging for the event has been secured close to the main venues. Travel plans to the event are secured for over-the-road travellers, with flyers waiting for proposal approval prior to ticket purchase. Details for the ETH Denver Core event are currently limited, but being followed closely with the guidance of LostLocal. The team is in process of procuring team gear and coordinating with partners such as the ETH Denver Polygon team for collaborative opportunities.

ETH Denver #BUIDLWeek kicks off February 24th and runs to March 1st. The Core event runs from March 2nd to March 5th. There is a Mountain retreat running from March 6th to the 9th. Attendance to the retreat costs extra, and many of our members have not opted in for this. No allocated proposal funding will be utilised for the optional Mountain Retreat.

Fully expanded proposal details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJpbepEWpZnxTn3mlEO9ts_RFdI2npBkGBSXb151lPM)

* Please refer to the above document for amendments. Changes were made to the travel and lodging budgets.

Thank you for taking the time to read our proposal and for the continued community support. With frens like you we are definitely GMI.

### Launching The Aavegotchi Forge
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #61**

**Proposal Summary:**

**Completed Forge Whitepaper:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RvlJmCRudFnso45oPU0veBqo-OLwwZiMJDaNBjRhf54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RvlJmCRudFnso45oPU0veBqo-OLwwZiMJDaNBjRhf54)

I propose that we launch the Aavegotchi Forge! This proposal combines all previous Forge-related signal proposals into a final core proposal. The Core Framework has already been submitted and accepted as a core proposal (AGIP 57). The Completed Forge Whitepaper outlines all Forge mechanics and economics. The Whitepaper will be updated with Forge v1.1- Geodes expansion when the mechanic has been finalized.

The signal proposals included in this core proposal:
* [The Forge v1.1 – Geodes Funding and Implementation](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x23655a075cd863a6c91f5a55557413c2b20b6cf3d41ab12c575437b321e9b851)
* [Forge Raffle Strategy and Revenue Splits](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xfd80fb620a1bfc80f1796d5f3cdc47bb62223e7ccbb8333bd4d7deb76c9f1fd9)

* [The Forge- Establishing Alloy Ratio](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xac0a2081017c0540538e877d9bb5f2d8c87dcc1bc47d50435bbfd89cdfcb4962)

The DAO modifiable variables:

The following are built-in variables designed as levers for the DAO to control.

1). Alloy return on smelting
* Currently set at 90% of the amount required to forge
* Of the 10% not returned, launch settings are the following:
    * 50% of alloy sent to a burn address
    * 50% of alloy sent to the DAO

2). Core Framework Ratios and Sales – Already passed in AGIP 57

3). Essence destination on Forging
* Settings on launch: 50% of essence will be burnt; 50% sent to the DAO

This proposal has no major adjustments from the passed signal proposals to the final product.

### Infinity Keys X Aavegotchi Paartnership
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #62**

**Proposal Summary:**

This CoreProp is for funding the Infinity Keys X Aavegotchi Onboarding Hunt. Infinity Keys put forth a discussion forum post [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/infinity-keys-x-aavegotchi/4595), has attended several Saturday Hangouts and Sunday DAO meetings to discuss their proposal, and include longtime members of the Aavegotchi community.

If you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr.

* 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new players, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives.

* 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a passcode hidden in the gotchiverse.

* These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play.

* At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants.

* There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops.

* Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi

One question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And what's more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete.

We have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community, more players will come to test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi.

One of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point. This onboarding comes from a deep understanding of the Gotchi community and how the system functions from an insider's perspective, but has the Alchemica to reach new players and bring them in.

### Aavegotchi X The Sandbox
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #63**

**Proposal Summary:**

The GFA Sandbox team proposes to launch the creation of the Aavegotchi X The Sandbox Experience. It follows the great feedback we got from the Proof of Concept presented in January and the SigProp that received the support of the DAO.

This proposal aligns with the recent Aavegotchi Blog Post related to 2023 “The Year of the Gotchi.” We are convinced that having Aavegotchi in The Sandbox will bring exposure from a large user base to our ecosystem.

**Bringing Aavegotchi into the Sandbox will contribute to achieving Aavegotchi’s three main focuses of 2023: Player growth, Partnerships and Decentralization.**

As described in the DAO Discord Thread, we have an Aavegotchi IP Licence and are discussing  the details of this partnership with The Sandbox but we already have some exclusive intel to share. The Alpha Season 4 is on its way (End Q2 2023) and Aavegotchi could be part of it if the DAO supports this initiative! With these Sandbox experiences, Aavegotchi DAO will be able to republish again for another Alpha season or in the future on their own lands.

**Please note these additions upon the feedback received from the SigProp and the most recent discussions with The Sandbox:**

- Maintenance and Updates: The SigProp mentions "New updates or features to be added after those releases are out of this scope of work." This point will evolve regarding the last discussions we had with The Sandbox and expectations from DAO members. We got the confirmation that the time between the Alpha season 4 with experiences v0.8 (Q2 on sandbox lands) and the expected date for Land owners to be able to release experiences on their own lands shouldn't be too far from each other. That's the reason this proposal includes maintenance and updates until Aavegotchi DAO is willing to publish its own experiences on land (1 Major Gamemaker version update to 0.9 ie). As 0.8 just went out, Sandbox confirmed that the next release isn't right around the corner...

- Ownership: As explained in Hangouts and DAO calls with the community, the GFA does not claim the ownership of any asset or account used / created in this whole process. The limited license agreement entrusts the GFA team to create and use digital assets based on Aavegotchi intellectual property (10% royalty to PC). All source files from asset creations (.VXM / . VXR / ...) and credentials of the Sandbox account (dedicated account) are licensed for a specified purpose and scope: the development and maintenance of our Sandbox Aavegotchi experience.

This proposal will also lead to some returns upon:
- Marketing Strategy (Ownership and specific tokens/assets) for experienced players (Gotchis i.e.)
- Aavegotchi and Sandbox project Aura and community
- Incentivized events (cross universe/easter eggs/enigmas/contests/leaderboard/prize pools/Twitch Live/AMA/Crew3 quests)
- Avatars / Wearables Sales (5% commission to Sandbox)
- Original Assets sales

**This Core Proposal is to fund 195k GHST for the creation of two Aavegotchi Experiences in the next 4 months as per:**

* The production costs
* The side Costs (Project management tool licenses / Promotion / Creation process events / Sandbox Grant discussions and negotiations)
* Incentives (In-game and Cross-Universe)

Those costs cover 2 experiences:

* A single player game on a 2x2 land with multiple layers dedicated to Aavegotchi environments
* A multiplayer game on a 1x1 land with multiple layers

We will start to work on these 2 experiences right after this voting session if the DAO supports it.

**A detailed funding request is available here if you missed it in the DAO Thread:** [https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/aavegotchi/optimized/2X/e/e2e7fd532e25a686269be903dfb79fa95cf703f5_2_936x396.jpeg](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/aavegotchi/optimized/2X/e/e2e7fd532e25a686269be903dfb79fa95cf703f5_2_936x396.jpeg)

We are proposing a split funding with DAI & GHST from the treasury holdings (900k DAI and 4M GHST):

**95 kGHST + 110 kDAI (rate : 1 GHST = $1.10)**

The idea is to limit the selling pressure on GHST for the production compensation part. This would be 2 payments operated by the DAO Fondation. The release would be settled this way:

**50% at start (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI)**

**50% mid-journey (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI)**

Mid-journey achievements to be judged would be based on The Sandbox milestones already settled in the timeline to be signed in order to be ready for the end of Q2 2023. The Beta Version is planned for the beginning of May and is the milestone to be considered. According to our contracts PC + The Sandbox would judge the quality of that mid term release.

This funding includes some incentives to be distributed to engaged players and Aavegotchi community members.

Thank you for your support Frens and get to your votes!

### Close the GHST Bonding Curve
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #64**

**Proposal Summary:**

AavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST Bonding Curve. This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAO’s DAI stable coin.

Closing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions.

*The Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today*

“The Curve is forever” is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHST’s tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion.

While MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the “Endgame” plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool.

Even if one concludes that DAI’s risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAI’s depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable.

*Aavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own*

AavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the company’s readiness to also manage the DAI at scale.

With nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC’d and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people!

It is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve.

*Allocation of the Curve’s DAI*

Turning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems.

So far, the DAI in the Curve’s contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curve’s closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol.

My originally paired Signal Proposal regarding allocation of DAI was voted down. However, another Signal Proposal written by Immaterial and Fantasma has passed with over 80% support. Titled “25/25/25/25 split for curve DAI”, that SigProp was upgraded to CoreProp shortly after the publishing of this proposal you are now reading.

IF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp passes alongside this proposal to close the curve, then DAI post-Curve closure shall be allocated in accordance with it.

IF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp does not pass, but this proposal to close the curve does pass,  Curve’s on-chain vote on Aragon will not happen until a new CoreProp regarding DAI allocation is passed.

*Process:*

Assuming both CoreProps pass, the process for our community to close the GHST Bonding Curve will happen in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps:

Sunday, Feb 26

This CoreProp and a DAI distribution CoreProp must both pass in order to confirm AavegotchiDAO’s intention and terms. If passed, the Aragon on-chain vote to close the GHST Bonding Curve begins in the days following shortly after.

*Achieving quorum on our on-chain vote requires 8% of total GHST supply to participate. That means GHST holders need to coordinate migrating GHST back to Ethereum between now and the vote so that we can honor the AGIP and successfully close the Curve.

IF Aragon vote successfully closes the Curve:

The Curve will immediately close, capping the supply of GHST. Any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the terms of the 25/25/25/25 AGIP.

*Risks*

The risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes.

Without deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market.

There is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility.

*Benefits*

The benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review:

Remove all risk of Aavegotchi’s success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI)

Complete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties.

Improve GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time.

*Conclusion*

For the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystem’s meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we’ve learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the vision’s development is completely within AavegotchiDAO’s control.

We are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Let's use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO.

### 25/25/25/25 Split for Curve DAI
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #65**

**Proposal Summary:**

We would like to put forward our own proposal that we believe is the fairest way to allocate the funds whilst also protecting asset holders. We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft, and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO.

The split would be as follows:

* Liquidity: 25%

* The DAO: 25%

* Pixelcraft: 25%

* Protocol rewards: 25%

By protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. A yes vote for protocol rewards in this case does not mean a yes vote for ongoing RF in its current iteration, it protects funds to be used to make sure that protocol assets remain liquid and sufficiently included in the economic cycle/paradigm going forward.

A yes vote for protocol rewards signals to loyal supporters of the protocol that the original vision remains intact, rather than being diverted into new and unproven games and business models.

Without inclusion/correlation between GHST and assets, great economic disruption could follow the turning off of the curve for asset owners. A stream of funding protocol rewards for two years not only creates an ongoing source of buy side liquidity for the GHST token, it also allows market participants to trust in the correlation between GHST and protocol assets.

As we prepare to release the Forge and GBM different assets, we have the choice to signal to market participants whether they are bidding into a single RF season, or towards inclusion in the economic benefits of the platform for a full two years from here.

### Form and Fund the Curve Transition Team
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #66**

**Proposal Summary:**

We propose the formation of a DAO Curve Transition Team (CTT) to assist the DAO in managing liquidity and treasury on a contingent basis prior to and after turning off the GHST curve should the DAO consent. We have numerous problems to tackle which need thoughtful investigation. The CTT will provide detailed summaries and analysis of our current state and potential paths moving forward regarding liquidity and asset management. These are some of the main questions the CTT will address and provide potential paths and analyses for DAO consideration:

*Regarding liquidity:*

* Should current treasury assets be used to provide liquidity prior to the curve being turned off?

* If so, how much? What wallet will hold these LP tokens? Will that liquidity remain after the curve DAI is distributed? Should the DAO stake those LP tokens for GLTR?

* Should the DAO keep GHST-USDC as the primary liquidity pool? If supporting any secondary pools, where do we diversify out?

* What is our goal amount of decentralized liquidity?

* How does this compare to current liquidity? How fast should we seek to establish our goal amount?

* What are potential estimations for impermanent loss with different potential trajectories for GHST?

* Should we turn off GLTR rewards for amGHST and move them elsewhere?

*Regarding treasury management:*

* What are our operations for treasury management?

* What wallet is holding the funds?

* Is our operational security process adequate?

* Are we keeping funds in DAI or moving to alternative assets?

* What other stablecoins would we consider?

* What other crypto assets would we consider? ETH, BTC, MATIC? On what chain?

* What DeFi protocols should we consider for treasury management?

* Which ones should we meet with and what liquidity mining rewards should we aim for?

* Should we perform GHST buybacks? If so, how? What are the potential impacts and costs of such a strategy at different liquidity targets?

* What should be done with interest earned? GHST buybacks? Compounding into the asset earning interest?

To answer the above questions with sufficient market research, we propose a 10,000 GHST bounty. We aim to provide the DAO a complete analysis within 3 weeks with multiple potential paths for consideration. Efficient treasury management will provide yield to keep our operations sustainable while also directing liquidity to ensure decentralized access to our core product.

### Curve Transition Plan - Securing funds for liquidity
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #67**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Important note:* Currently there is $38M of DAI in the curve contract, 30% more than when sigprop went live, so we are asking for a bit more funds than in sigprop ($4M increased to $5M). This increase allows us to increase the liquidity on the DEXs a little more and not end up with cash intended for liquidity that would end up lying idle.

Hello Frens!

The core proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25/25/25/25% split is likely to pass.

One of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery.

At the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the impermanent loss risks when the curve will close.

*The liquidity provision will be split in 2 plans:*

* Pre-curve plan: Ensure high liquidity for the curve transition.

* Post-curve plan: Buyback (protocol rewards), DAO treasury management, liquidity reallocations after price discovery.

In the sigprop we had asked to secure $4M for the pre-curve plan while having fairly approximate plans, so after discussions with Balancer and Quickswap we are coming back with a more detailed plan.

This core-prop only discusses the pre-curve plan to ensure liquidity on DEXs.

We have a liquidity target of around $5M+, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage.

*PRE-CURVE PLAN:*

DEXs: Quickswap and Balancer.

*BALANCER LIQUIDITY PROVISION:*

We have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmy's 110k).

To add DAO liquidity, we chose an 80(GHST)-20(Stable) type pool. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, this type of pool looks quite interesting.

To use 950k DAI in the Balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.50:

80-20 pool: 2560000 GHST (4,750,000$ pool total)

This liquidity injection must occur 3 days before the close of the curve.

*Bribes program:*

It is possible for the DAO to deploy 6M DAI (this number depends on the number of DAI at the close of the curve) on Balancer and earn 5% (~300k annual) + 5-6% BAL rewards. (For the rest of the calculation we will take the worst case: 5% APY total on the DAI => 300k$/year)

Then we can use the 300k+ in DAI rewards to bribe the 80-20 GHST-STABLE pool, giving the DAO more rewards. This allows us to yield on our treasury and not let it sleep without yield.

Bribes are done via Snapshot, which will require regular participation between our Snapshot DAO and Balancer.

*QUICKSWAP V3 LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM:*

To achieve the liquidity target, we believe that a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO is worthwhile.

We are targeting $3M+ in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require 160,000 GHST in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $4 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program must begin 3 days before the curve closes and last for 2 months.

We expect between 10% and 20% of the GHST amount in Quick rewards from Quickswap team for the liquidity mining rewards on their V3 (full range liquidity).

For technical reasons, we cannot add all these rewards to the existing GLTR staking contract. So liquidity providers will have to choose between the GLTR rewards and the GHST + Quick rewards.

So, to summarize, we are asking the DAO to add 2,560,000 GHST with the 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury to a 80-20 Balancer pool. This pool will be bribed by the DAO through treasury management thereafter.

This provision of liquidity by the DAO will allow the DAO to earn swap fees and BAL rewards thus obtaining more cash flow.

In addition to these numbers, we are asking the DAO to sponsor a Quickswap LM program with 160,000 GHST.

Doing a liquidity program can be smarter in high volatility times because a 50-50 pool is very prone to impermanent losses, and we prefer incentive liquidity rather than having the DAO lose money through IL.

### Fund fireball.gg Team to Develop Guilds
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #68**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Changes from SigProp:* The previous SigProp funding request was for 25,000 GHST. The funding request for this CoreProp is for 27,500 DAI (a fixed price of $1.10 per GHST from the previous funding request).

*BEGINNING*

Last year, within the fireball.gg team we tried to imagine how guilds may look like in Aavegotchi. We deployed a guilds list page https://fireball.gg/guilds where players could group up and claim their spot as a guild inside the Gotchiverse!

Twenty one brave guild leaders with their guilds passed through a github pull request quest and participated in this imaginary guild claim!

*NEXT STEPS*

Using all of our knowledge and insight, a new guild model was constructed, with given properties:

- on chain solution based on https://app.safe.global/ makes it very convenient to pull all related guild stats
- to participate there is no need to move any assets or any change in custody
- guild warehouse (inventory) out of the box
- name (flag) as non-transferable NFT
- we teach our community how to best use the safe app!

From a guild leader perspective the guild creation process would be something like:

1. initiation transaction (deploy an empty gnosis safe)
2. **claim a guild flag-name in registry contract**
3. (optional) add members and other associated addresses
4. (optional) set warehouse access rights

*DELIVERABLES*

The deliverables are separated in two stages (both are included within the current funding request):

Version 2 — core features needed to start building guilds within the community and integration with ecosystem projects (Gotchiverse, STRATEGOTCHI and possibly others)

Version 3 — a feasibility study for the experimental features based on data from the first two versions

*Version 2:*

(a) smart contract with the following capabilities:

1. guild registration
2. guild deletion
3. guild name-flag as a non-transferable NFT

(b) a custom data graph with a specific guilds and aavegotchi related stats:

1. voting power
2. assets (gotchis, wearables, land, etc)

*Version 3:*

(a) updates to the smart contract:

1. guilds legacy — a historical NFT issued to remember historical events, like tournaments
2. advanced guild warehouse access framework on https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope/

(b) guilds market

(c) other needed features based on data from version 2

*BUDGET*

(in DAI)

- model, organization, integrations (ordengg) — 14,300
- smart contract (PG) — 8,250
- graph and data structures (ordengg) — 3,300
- visual assets (FakeGotchis artists) — 1650

*OWNERSHIP*

After the guilds framework is stable we can:

(a) transfer registry to the dao

(b) deploy a new guild registry system to and from the dao which will effectively give us the “Official Aavegotchi Guilds!”

*TIMELINE*

Version 2 — April-May

Version 3 — June-July

*INTEGRATIONS*

Having guilds makes pvp, farming and development much more interesting! The fireball.gg team has agreements in place to test new guild mechanics with other Aavegotchi sponsored projects:

1. integration with https://gotchiboard.com/ will open a road for guild specific tournaments!

2. Integration with STRATEGOTCHI will help with guilds registrations and leaderboards data.

### Securing Protocol Rewards - Operational & Funding Request
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #69**

**Proposal Summary:**

*CoreProp summary (important parts):*

Buyback schedule specifications for buying $GHST protocol rewards outlined in AGIP65. This includes consideration of a non-linear 18-month buying schedule with a 2-month long multiplier for purchase amounts to coincide with the liquidity mining plan, and the funding of an automated smart contract to execute purchases with various features. More details below:

*INTRO*

Per AGIP65 25% of the unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve are supposed to be allocated for securing protocol rewards in the form of rarity farming rewards. To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request.

*1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program:*

The main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO.

Filling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases.

For voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards.

It is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program.

*2) Smart Contract*

The proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST.

This proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production.

The expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users:

- Gelato automation tooling
- Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery
- Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks
- Toggling for slippage rate tolerance
- Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase
- potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities.

*Funding Request:*

We are seeking a separate request of $5000 DAI (or $5000 worth of $GHST) to complete this contract as it will require ongoing maintenance and wasn’t anticipated in AGIP66 when the team was funded to conduct market research mainly.

### Alchemica + GLTR Taskforce Funding
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #70**

**Proposal Summary:**

I've spent the last couple of weeks recruiting a diverse taskforce to generate ideas, conduct research and create sig props for our Alchemica + GLTR tokenomics. I hoped to find 8 members but ended up getting 10 amazing applications from some of the best minds and contributors in the community. These members have different types/sizes of holdings and different political/philosophical viewpoints to represent the diversity of our DAO as closely as possible.

We plan to split into vertical teams of 1-3 to work on ideas and come together on weekly public calls to collaborate and provide feedback. This means, as a taskforce, we will constantly be progressing 4-5 ideas in parallel. The projects we intend to start with are:

*Kinship Channelling*

* @Immaterial

*GLTR emissions/sinks research*

* @Maxicrouton
* @Webb
* @Umami

*GLTR Raffles*

* @soloegoist

*Guild/District Tokenomics*

* @HARDKOR
* @AL

*New Alchemica/GLTR sinks ideation*

* @Gotchinomics
* @kuwlness

*Media work (weekly summary videos)*

* @Nofuturistic

We are asking for funding for 5 hours of work per week at 25 GHST/hour for each of our members on a monthly rolling basis. This will make sure our community members are compensated for this important work and will keep them accountable to ensure that, as a DAO, we are constantly progressing our tokenomics.

The total funding for this month will be: 10 members * 25 GHST/hour * 5 hour/week * 4 weeks = 5000 GHST

As we have already started work, the 4 weeks will run from 6th of March until 2nd April.

### Gotchi Lodge 2023 Budget Revision
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #71**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Change from Sigprop:* The disbursement was requested to be paid in GHST, this has been changed to DAI

The 2023 Gotchi Lodge was a major success, with the Aavegotchi project being one of the best-represented projects at ETH Denver 2023.

The Lodge started with six core team members but quickly became the Gotchi Hostel, accommodating seven Gotchigang cavalry members into the mix. These members proved to be critical to the great representation we had across all venues.

Key performance metrics proved challenging to quantify, but there was a noticeable increase in Twitter and discord engagement, Bazaar activity, External and internal enthusiasm for Aavegotchi, and BD/partnership leads post-event.

While the impact went far, we would like to fairly compensate all attending members at appropriate rates for the work done, and the initial budget set out for the event cannot accommodate that. Below is a complete breakdown of estimated vs actual hours, unforeseen expenses, preparation and long-tail labor (not taken into account), and finally, our request in USD terms.

This being our first IRL activation as AavegotchiDAO, we over-delivered and initially underestimated ourselves, and the current budget reflects that. As a team, we are coming away from this event with immense experience in planning future events.

*Deliverables*

The team hit across all metrics in the initial proposal and then some. There was a noticeable increase in internal and external enthusiasm for the Aavegotchi protocol during our presence in Denver.

*Estimated hours vs actual*

The original Estimate for a workday was:
* 7 hours/day
* $15/hr
* Ten days in total

Final Production Payout Structure was updated to:
* 12 hours/day (reflective of actual hours from arriving and leaving main venues)
* $21/hr
* Ten days in total for core event staff
* Additional days allocated for long tail labor regarding prep and post-production

*Unforeseen Expenses*

Calvary team members' support; all who stepped up put in immense work and were critical to our mission. Most of them gave up their booth-browsing time to help us.

Sticker production costs were late-stage additions, but immense value adds in promoting Aavegotchi + creating awareness for Fake Gotchis.

Crafting supplies for Marijuana mansion, Art Work Prints, and Framing

An extensive amount of driving for the vehicle team

*Preparation and long-tail labor*

We genuinely undervalued and underestimated the work on the front and back end of EthDenver.

*Front end*

Hefe & Mycaleum: Many hours were spent planning, scheduling, and working with event organizers to secure panel slots. We also put time into budget management and funding necessary travel expenses for team members while waiting for the initial funding proposal to clear.

*Back end*

NoFuturistic continues to work on post-event content editing and distribution.

Hefe & Mycaleum: We have been working on the budget with actual expenses as well as the distribution of costs and compensation. We also put lots of time into crafting this budget extension proposal.

TBurd completed his photo album edits and uploading.

Smokescreens is working on a b-roll for behind-the-scenes clips and footage.

Zombie Shepheard assisting with post-event media delivery and lead follow-up

Kontak has large content libraries to edit and share with NF for distribution.

Dr. Wagmi and Diddly have continuing BD discussions with project teams that met in Denver.

*Funding Request in USD*

The initial funding proposal [AGIP 60] was $11,723, paid in GHST at delivery on February 11th, 2023.

The requested extension is $19,255 USD, paid in DAI.

We appreciate the continued support and look forward to future IRL activations with the Gotchigang!

### Liquidity Provision: Reimbursement of the DAO
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #72**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Changes from SigProp:* The original Sigprop had four options for GHST Reimbursement, this CoreProp only includes the option that got the most support.

Little summary of where we are in the $7.5M liquidity allocation from the curve closing.

*What has been used:*
- QUICKSWAP LM program : 160,000 GHST (took from DAO wallet)
- BALANCER POOL : 2,580,000 GHST and 926,022 USDC (taken from DAO wallet. [https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xae27fed433feac9a4eb8a73871fbf307de107255fdb0d0fa289c81d065adb8a6](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xae27fed433feac9a4eb8a73871fbf307de107255fdb0d0fa289c81d065adb8a6?ref=blog.aavegotchi.com))

These funds (about $5M) used prior to the curve closing came from the DAO wallet, which we took roughly $4M worth of GHST and $1M DAI.

So we need to reimburse the DAO wallet with these $5M borrowed, we have two options:

1) Reimburse all the funds ($5M) in DAI.

2) Reimburse the $4M worth of GHST in GHST, so it means using DAI to buyback GHST.

If we choose to reimburse in GHST, the schedule of swaps to pay back the DAO could be 6 months. (With constant swaps over the period)

Not having too long of a timeline will help to have an average price closer to the price when we borrowed the funds.

The original Sigprop had four options for GHST Reimbursement, this CoreProp only includes the option that got the most support. Which is:

1 GHST is 1 GHST, trying to reimburse the 2,740,000 GHST borrowed with $5M DAI (Would be at maximum $5M purchase of GHST, can be lower if we suceed to get enought GHST to reimburse the DAO with less than $5M)

*Technical details for the DAO directors:*

Deploy a new "swap contract" (see AGIP 69) with the Liquidity wallet as owner

Swap 3/4/5/$7.5M DAI into USDC. (can be done in little chunks)

Send 3/4/5/$7.5M USDC to the contract. (can be done in little chunks)

Send GHST to the Treasury Wallet

*Note: The 6 months swaps timeline specified can be changed to any timeline if the DAO is willing to.*

### Liquidity Provision: Adding the $2.5M left in a Quickswap Pool
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #73**

**Proposal Summary:**

Little summary of where we are in the $7.5M liquidity allocation from the curve closing.

*What has been used:*
- QUICKSWAP LM program : 160,000 GHST (taken from DAO wallet)
- BALANCER POOL : 2,580,000 GHST and 926,022 USDC (taken from DAO wallet. [https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xae27fed433feac9a4eb8a73871fbf307de107255fdb0d0fa289c81d065adb8a6](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xae27fed433feac9a4eb8a73871fbf307de107255fdb0d0fa289c81d065adb8a6?ref=blog.aavegotchi.com))

We already used about $5M for adding liquidity on Balancer and for the LM program on Quickswap, so we have about $2.5M DAI left.

From these $2.5M DAI left, I propose to use 50% of this amount to buy GHST, and pool it with 50% USDC in a Quickswap pool (Gamma V3), increasing liquidity and cash flow for the DAO (through fees).

Concerning the schedule of swaps, all the swaps should be done in 2 months (constant swaps). I believe 2 months is appropriate. Not too long since the sooner we have liquidity the better it is for the DAO/ecosystem, and doing it in less than 2 months would dilute our own LM program.

*Technical details for the DAO directors:*

Deploy a new "swap contract" (see AGIP 69) with the Liquidity wallet as owner

Swap $1.25M DAI into USDC. (can be done in little chunks)

Send $1.25M USDC to the contract. (can be done in little chunks)

Wait 2 months for the swaps to finish.

Add all the funds on the GHST-USDC pool (Gamma V3 Quickswap pool)

### DAO Meeting Management and Delivery: One-time disbursement for fulfilled deliverables
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #74**

**Proposal Summary:**

I have taken feedback from the recent Media Team Signal proposal and am proposing a way to move forward;

In hindsight, a funding request for fulfilled deliverables and future funding should have been two separate proposals.

While there has been extensive discussion around ways information should be disseminated, there has been little pushback on the necessity of these meetings or the value they provide to stakeholders.

So, I would like to be made whole for my completed efforts there. I am happy to help formulate a new proposal in collaboration with the DAO based on aggregated feedback + additional input.

We can develop a satisfactory iteration of the previous DAO proposal reasonably quickly since extensive discussion exists. We will sort out details on management and delivery of meetings and associated media over 1-2 focused DAO calls. A subsequent proposal will get posted in addition to any challenging proposals (highly encouraged). The DAO can vote on the offering(s) of their choice.

This part of the last proposal did not seem like a point of contention and would serve as a reasonable way to continue moving forward with the DAO on what they would like to see from Sunday DAO calls.

January, February and March payments total 4800 GHST

*Treasury Details:*

4800 GHST priced @ the time of Signal Proposal Snapshot (1.07 USD/GHST)

Total disbursement amount in USD: 5,136

Paid out to 0xfD95Dea0f353618826d5FA94be862D9cb0d4dda8 within 48 hours of Core Proposal passing in either DAI or USDC

### Aavegotchi X Anata Collaboration
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #75**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Changes from SigProp:* The proposal at AnataDAO is currently passing. We also added clarification on how the Anatas will be bought and how the community can use the DAO owned Anatas.

*WHAT*

Provide Aavegotchi community with Anata NFT's. A similar proposal is passing with 100% in favor to buy Aavegotchi Gotchi’s from AnataDAO. The Anata team would TWAP buy GHST over a 1-3 day period and purchase Aavegotchi's / Portals on for our holders to participate in the Gotchiverse (Bazaar or Magic Eden, etc).

*ABOUT*

Anata is a collection of 2,000 Anime Themed VTube rigged avatars. It is the NFT you use on calls, streams, meetings, etc. Each anata counts as one vote in Anata DAO. Anata is an art project heavily catered towards content creators. So far, the DAO has voted to provide every Anata NFT holder a 3D VRM, 1/1 PFP, Chibi, Upgraded 2D Vtuber Files, Gaming & Metaverse world integrations.

Holders - 950

Active Members - 100 (ish)

Treasury - $4m+

Team - BigDSenpai, Grug, DCF God, Herro

*WHY*

I am a big believer in Aavegotchi. Some of you may remember I used to stream opening H1-H2 portals and giving away gotchi's at random to the community. I didn't have a Face Cam though - an Anata VTUBE avatar would have been perfect while playing - which makes chat and video way more interactive.

Anata has a very large gaming sector, with gaming events & nights firing off 4-5 times per week. It would be great to intertwine what we are doing with Pudgy Penguins, Cozy Penguins and other communities with Aavegotchi games.

**TLDR; more exposure into the Gotchiverse by helping eachother get community members involved in both projects.**

*COST*

A) $10,000 DAI  (4-5 Anata)

B) $20,000 DAI (9-11 Anata)

C) Do Nothing

Average Anata price is .69-1ETH, the "cost" really depends on how much the DAO would want to give out to the community. I am all in favor of starting small if everyone else is.

The proposal would only be executed assuming the Anata DAO proposal passes. This is probably the best way to learn about Anata in under 2.5 minutes: [https://twitter.com/AnataNFT/status/1625594906596249600](https://twitter.com/AnataNFT/status/1625594906596249600)

VOD of Moon playing Gotchi Miners: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1779138941](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1779138941)

*Aavegotchi DAO Owning Anatas*

Aavegotchi DAO will own the Anatas they purchase. Each Anata NFT comes with:

1. Fully rigged vtuber 2D Files
2. 3D VRM Files *soon to be completed*
3. 1/1 Profile Pictures
4. Any future releases tied to that specific Anata NFT # These files of the purchased Anata’s can be placed in an Aavegotchi holder-only discord channel for Aavegotchi community members to use.

*Aavegotchi DAO  Buying Anatas*

Aavegotchi DAO will buy an equal (as reasonably possible) amount of Male & Female Anatas at the best prices (floor) across multiple marketplaces Blur, Opensea, etc. within two weeks after the proposal passing.

### Create a DAO Treasury Dashboard
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #76**

**Proposal Summary:**

I (MikeyJay) propose creating a DAO Treasury Dashboard to provide a clear overview of the Aavegotchi DAO’s financial health and activity. This dashboard, created in collaboration with Eitri (eitri#0228), will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about the DAO’s operations and governance. It may also be useful to a bookkeeping and accounting team in the future, as it will provide summarized transaction information that can be posted as individual accounting ledger entries each month.

The dashboard will break down income sources, such as alchemica earned from Gotchiverse crafting, GHST earned from Baazaar fees and GBM auctions, and alloy earned from The Forge. It will also include a breakdown of various DAO token balances over time (GHST, DAI, alchemica, alloy, matic, and USDC).

The dashboard will be created using Dune Analytics. The complete specification for the dashboard can be reviewed here: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXVahA1sCNVdZntcTGUobbMByF55qNg3Sm8FGT4BuNDVd](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXVahA1sCNVdZntcTGUobbMByF55qNg3Sm8FGT4BuNDVd)

We aim to complete the dashboard within six weeks of the proposal's passage by the DAO. We request 2,000 DAI in funding, which we will allocate as follows:

* 1,500 DAI paid to Eitri to create the dashboard

* 500 DAI paid to myself for writing the specification and project management

*Potential Risks*

Our initial investigation suggests that we can use the freely available Dune Analytics to create the dashboard. However, there is a possibility that we may need a supplemental tool as work progresses. If we identify the need for a supplemental paid tool as work progresses, we will inform the DAO and, if necessary, seek approval for additional funding.

### Aavegotchi GHST Ship Summoning
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #77**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Changes from SigProp: The original Sigprop had requested payment in GHST, however the coreprop requests DAI.*

$7700 USD paid in DAI for Aavegotchi logo sail. This sail will be great passive advertising for us and allows for active marketing to charter clients.

I got a quote on a billboard in our area, they charge $1200 a month with around 5400 views a day and are sold out. We’d get 5 years easy compared to 6 months with a billboard with easily a few hundred sets of eyes on the sail each trip.

We run 100-130 trips throughout the year. Trips are 2-5+ hours and we often have 12+ people onboard. The boat is owned and paid for and the sail is expected to last 5 to 10+ years from this sail and the costs of a billboard or something similar are way higher and less unique and targeted.

115 trips x 3 hours= 345 hours/year

345 hours x 5 years =1725 hours

$7700/1725 hours =$4.4/per hour of advertising minimum

*BENEFITS*

Captive target audience with extra income and crypto knowledge, unique advertising opportunity, media capture, onboarding help and discounted sailing trips for Aavegotchi holders. Opens the door for a world of content creation and unique marketing with merch as well as offering a platform for IRL meetups. Building positive synergy between the DAO and community supporters. I've already been offering 50% off discounts for Aavegotchi holders for over a year.

*POTENTIAL RISK/DOWNSIDE*

Damage to sail due to extreme weather (Hurricane, high-wind events, etc.) and daily usage. Sail must be used in the appropriate wind conditions to avoid damage. Advertising/Marketing funds could be used in other places.

### Forge 2.0 Request for Funding
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #79**

**Proposal Summary:**

• Hire the Forge Team for a 3-month period with an overall UI/UX focus

• Planned deliverables: full geode functionality with refilling of prize pool with at least 3 new schematics; respec potion completion and distribution; strong UI/UX focus with main website integration of the Dressing Room w/ similar art/RPG feel as offered by the Forge UI; major improvements to Forge UI/UX; operationalize a schematic pipeline for new schematic releases

• No plans for further core or alloy release in this period

• Goal is for content to accrue value to native assets (gotchis, wearables)

• Backgrounds, wearable skins, evolving pets and a new BRS-modifying slot will be tabled for further technical development. The Forge Team will prevent the most viable and community-favored project(s) for the next Forge installment.

• Compensation is denominated in USD instead of GHST for a total of $161,825 for the Forge Team and a 10,000 GHST bounty budget

The Aavegotchi Forge Team proposes a 3 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing and improve features on the Aavegotchi protocol and User Interface. Over this three-month period, we plan to “stick the landing” for the Forge, add additional User Interface work w/ an integrated dressing room, and outline potential new features that can be pursued by the Forge Team or other design teams.

A contracted three-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 generated >$256,000 in total sales. We anticipate we will be able to continue to generate revenue without inflating cores or alloy and aim for budget neutrality or better while delivering new content, advancing the protocol, improving user experience, and providing value to native assets.

*Forge Team Roadmap:*

* Geodes: Regardless of this proposal, the Forge team will debut the minimal viable Geode ASAP with function to obtain the 400 legendary Forge set schematics. As part of this proposal, the Forge Team will develop additional schematics for some of the unmatched cores from the Forge Launch auction. Plan to reload the prize pool by the end of April, ideally with multi-tier rarity functionality.

* Review and complete the technical design and airdrop “Respec Potions”

* UI Upgrade: Integrate the “Dressing Room” to the main Aavegotchi website. Create a dress-up and buy now option with new art, new NPC, and Aavegotchi aesthetic. Additionally, we will focus on overall UI/UX improvement with the goal of maximally educating users on protocol assets.

    • Schematic pipeline – Will operationalize new schematic creation with predictable schematic releases, randomized/fair trait selection, intentional approach to avoid power creep, and maximally assist in translating new wearables to Gotchiverse functionality

* Updates to wearables.report (market data reporting) site to account for new wearables mechanics.

* Add a dashboard of metrics related to The Forge (include reporting on two new mechanics developed by The Forge team)

* Update existing metrics to account for changes in supply related to forging

* UI/UX improvements (mostly navigation related to accommodate additional content, with some minor aesthetic updates

* Back-end code improvements to allow for modularity and expandability in the future

*Future Project Outlines* – Forge Team to investigate and prepare potential proposals for the following:

* Outline and potentially implement the transition from FRENS to GLTR for raffle tickets

* New/Custom backgrounds – Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds and/or obtain Forge Team/Pixelcraft designed backgrounds

* Wearable skins/non-BRS-modifying wearables – Continue aesthetics focus by creating a path for wearable skins w/ goal to maximize community-created content.

* New BRS-modifying slot – Will be tabled for further economic and technical development for presentation to the DAO in Q3 2023*

* Evolving pets/Upgradeable wearables – Tabled for further technical development and separate proposal for the DAO, though it still may be implemented by the Forge Team during the 3-month period or beyond.*

*Forge Team Stipend:*

For this work, diddly will be hired on as a full-time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February-March 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 4 month total stipend vs 3 months for the rest of the team. The three other roles will be part time ~20 hours/week. The 10,000 GHST bounty budget is to maximize external contributions and facilitate open contributions as much as possible.

*Execution Details:*

* Three disbursements in DAI from the DAO Treasury Wallet to the Forge Team Wallet which will be specified in the core proposal:

* $61,825 upon passage of core proposal

* $50,000 30 days after passage of core proposal

* $50,000 60 days after passage of core proposal

* Funds will be sent to the following address: 0xa60CD32d13d1D99c1141eebD6D6F07652F19B982

In summary, we are requesting compensation for a dedicated 3-month period to form a devoted, highly skilled and proven team to continue developing the protocol. We strongly believe we will create more value than our asking cost as demonstrated by our previous success. We look forward to this period of exponential growth and helping the DAO continue its transition through the metamorphosis phase.

### Fund development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #80**

**Proposal Summary:**

The Strategotchi team is seeking a grant to complete the design and development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version. The team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability.

*Introductory post + litepaper:*

[https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671)

*Long Term Value:*

Additionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption.

*A Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game*

Our game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore It features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference.

*Guild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution:*

[https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/guild-cards-season-1-tokenomics-and-distribution/4724](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/guild-cards-season-1-tokenomics-and-distribution/4724)

*Token Sinks:*

The game will provide a sink for native tokens through “Ranked Mode” buy-ins in GHST and/or Alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables.

*Guild vs Guild:*

Along with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies

*Gotchichain:*

With the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience. This is why PC sees the potential for Strategotchi to launch with heavy support in Gotchichain's launch window

*Budget:*

We are seeking 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) paid in 2 installments. A 50% upfront payment of 65,700 USD to be transferred upon successful passing of a core prop. The subsequent 50% (65,700 USD) to be paid upon the successful completion of the single player mode MVP (based on DAO foundation members’ judgment)

*Deliverables:*

* Season 1 Guild Cards Distribution (GBM)

* Single player mode (digital)

* Multiplayer mode (digital)

* Inaugural Guild Tournament (precursor to Guild Waarz)

*Cost Breakdown:*

* Development: 61,200 USD

* Art: 48,200 USD

* Management: 22,000 USD

* Total: 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent)

* Original budget: 87.6k GHST ($1.5/GHST)

* Roadmap + Budget: [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/strategotchi-roadmap-budget-proposal/4711](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/strategotchi-roadmap-budget-proposal/4711)

*Conclusion:*

We believe this project has the potential to attract a new player base and expose the Aavegotchi IP to a new audience of strategy game enthusiasts, aligning it with the 2023 roadmap set out by PC, focusing on gaming and player growth.

It also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition.

As of today, I have achieved a verbal understanding with PC to have a limited licensing agreement extended to this project. Such a license will move into drafting and signatures only after the passage of this Sigprop. The agreement grants PC 20% of the revenue, and includes their support with smart contract development. (The remaining 80% is to be split evenly between player rewards and the DAO.)

*It's important to emphasize that this grant is specifically for the digital version of the game, although plans for an official PC physical version are already being discussed. From my talks with the PC team, they are very enthusiastic about the idea and already have multiple manufacturing and distribution leads for the tabletop physical.*

We are super excited and highly driven to embark on this ebic project, frens. With your support, Strategotchi aims to establish itself as a reliable and valuable contributor to the ecosystem over the long haul. We are eager to have your backing and work together to transform our aspirations into a reality!

### DAO Directors : Treasury officer role
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #81**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Changes from Sigprop: This role will remain until the directors are re-elected.*

Hello frens!

With the end of the curve, a substantial amount of funds has been given to the DAO. The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe it's crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO.

DAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. That's why I am running for the position of treasurer.

*The purpose of the treasurer role would be to:*

• Ensure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without misinterpretation possible.•Ensure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc.

• Prepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all.

• Stay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury.

• Additionally, the role would also serve as an "expert" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO.

As a current director, I receive a payment of 2,000 GHST every three months. Given the active nature of the treasurer role, I plan to dedicate two hours per day to this role and will be requesting an increase in compensation to 5,000 GHST per three months.

*Why choose me (Maxicrouton)?*

* I possess in-depth knowledge of DeFi and market making, enabling me to provide valuable advice on all financial decisions related to the DAO.

* I am well-versed in the DAO's structure and DAO fund locations. I think having a go-to person for all treasury matters can be helpful for the DAO.

* My participation in the Curve transition team and in directors group allow me to be aware and understand every fund move.

*Thank you for considering me for the treasurer role.*

### Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #82**

**Proposal Summary:**

This proposal re-attempts to change kinship mechanics so that kinship points are burned during each Gotchi channeling event. Current Alchemica emission trajectories forecast an annual increase of 40% in supply due to persistent increases in Gotchi kinship multipliers at no cost to the player. The proposed change is a -2 kinship point burn per each Gotchi channeling event.

Additionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to “NO” to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship.

*Some benefits of this proposal:*

* Players will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games.

* Develops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility.

* There is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games.

* The specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change.

* Alchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets.

*Potential Risks*

* Players with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is:

* Less engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity.

* Additional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers.

*This work was the result of several people’s efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards.*

### Thank Aavegotchi Pilot
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #83**

**Proposal Summary:**

Aavegotchi DAO members provide extraordinary support to the DAO. They could provide even more - and better - support if they are thanked for their valuable DAO contributions with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note!

We propose a 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot to thank (reward and recognize) valuable contributions to Aavegotchi DAO with $GHST + an on-chain thank you note. We’ll do it in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain, and protects against bots and bad actors.

The impact of rewarding Aavegotchi DAO members for your value-creating contributions should be greater efficiency, utility, and value for Aavegotchi DAO as well as more shared ownership in our community.

During pilot, we will test 3 different rewards formats in 3 1-month “seasons”:

Season 1: 15k total $GHST raffled to 30 winners. Each contribution you make to the DAO earns you “raffle tickets”.

Season 2: 15k total $GHST rewarding each valuable contribution you make.

Season 3: 15k total $GHST rewarding you in rarity-farming style.

At the culmination of the third month, the community will vote on which rewards format you prefer. If a follow-up proposal passes to continue our pilot for an additional 3 months, rewards for the second pilot will be in the winning format.

### Rarity Farming Season 6
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #84**

**Proposal Summary:**

The sigprop to start rarity farming has passed, so I am proposing that we start rarity farming season 6 ASAP at the conclusion of this vote, should it succeed.

This proposal suggests keeping reward parameters the same as the prior several seasons and deferring any significant changes until Season 7 towards the end of the year. Last season used the following reward parameters:

4 Rounds (2 weeks each), 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury

* 70% BRS

* 20% Kinship

* 10% XP

Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)

Launch period: Season 6 round 1 to commence as soon as possible after the conclusion of the voting period.

Thank you as always for your consideration and your votes!

### Schedule all Act 1 Parcel Surveys (re-rolls)
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #85**

**Proposal Summary:** I propose that Parcel Re-rolls be scheduled and recurring every three months to complete ACT 1. Further survey rolls and tokenomics of Acts 2 and 3 can be proposed by Pixelcraft or the Aavegotchi DAO. This predictability will ensure investors have prior investment decisions honored and to be more confident in future investments. The Pixelcraft team continues to develop the Gotchiverse and GotchiGuardians which will create further sinks and a healthy, sustainable ecosystem.

This will continue to push alchemica emissions away from channeling and into farming. It will allow Pixelcraft clear dates around which to target a Great Battle or similar climactic experience for the rounds. It also affords more confident participation in the alchemica spending competitions which have been very successful to date.

*Minor changes from sig prop to core prop:*

* Clarification of dates w/ addition of Survey #10

* Dates are an estimate based on proximity to Pixelcraft shipping Fridays.

*Historical Survey Dates:*

* Survey #1 (Initial Farm release): 7/20/2022 (25% of alchemica in act 1)

* Survey #2: 3/3/2023 (8.33% as are all surveys 2-10)

*Proposed Survey rolls (estimates based on closest PC shipping Friday):*

* Survey #3: 6/16/2023
* Survey #4: 9/8/2023
* Survey #5: 12/1/2023
* Survey #6: 2/23/2024
* Survey #7: 5/17/2024
* Survey #8: 8/9/2024

### Gotchi Battler funding
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #86**

**Proposal Summary:**

This sigprop is to obtain funding for the development of Gotchi Battler. I've assembled a team of some of the best builders in the community and we're excited to get started and build what is hopefully a prize asset for the DAO and community for years to come. Please read on to get an overview of the game, costs and deliverables and if you want a deeper dive into the game including a trailer please visit the forum post: [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772)

*What is Gotchi battler?*

Gotchi Battler is an auto battler game where 2 teams of 5 gotchis battle each other until 1 team is wiped out. Each Gotchis stats and special move will be determined by its traits. To set up a good team you’ll have to strategise what types of Gotchis mix well together and what formation the team should be in. Once you’ve set up the team you can sit back and watch your strategy play out in an epic Gotchi battle to the death!

*Why Gotchi Battler?*

I created a long post detailing the motivation behind building Gotchi Battler here: [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772/21?u=immaterial](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772/21?u=immaterial) So please go read that post but the TLDR headlines are:

### OTC Agreement for GHST Holdings of 0VIX Users
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #87**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Modifications from sigprop:*

1. Removed explicit multisig address as it will be voted in a separate proposal focused on the returning of funds

2. Added paragraph (lines 23-26) to explain on how OTC price will be calculated in a verifiable way.

*Introduction:*

In order to prevent a negative market impact of a sudden liquidation of 763,624 GHST tokens, an Over-the-Counter (OTC) transaction for DAI held in the AAVEGOTCHI DAO treasury is being proposed. @Maxicrouton is one of the main points of contact here that will assist with that transaction. This method is preferable due to its ability to reduce a substantial price pressure that could result from a sell order of this magnitude.

*Objectives:*

In essence the goal is to secure a fair OTC deal that meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved. Aavegotchi DAO’s goal is to mitigate the sell pressure on the GHST token while concurrently ensuring the rightful owners of the funds receive their funds 0VIX users want to have a fair price and get the maximum value from funds recuperated

To circumvent market volatilities, the OTC price will be defined by averaging Chainlink prices over the time period that this CoreProp is voted on.

To derive the price of the GHST / DAI pair from Chainlink, the block-per-block price feeds on Polygon PoS will be used. The final OTC price for swapping GHST into DAI will be determined as the simple average of all the GHST/DAI pair prices derived at each block (~300k distinct values).

Upon passing of the CoreProp vote, a csv file and simple script will be submitted to the Aavegotchi DAO with the final OTC price value for everyone to verify publicly.

Script link: [https://gist.github.com/pestopoppa/28630e7a6ae0215e071de7decf678e6a](https://gist.github.com/pestopoppa/28630e7a6ae0215e071de7decf678e6a)

*Option A:*

Yes to the OTC deal at a fixed price. That option offers the key advantage of price certainty and stability for both Aavegotchi DAO and 0VIX users. It circumvents market volatility by averaging prices over the days that the CoreProp is voted on, thus providing a quick execution route for the transaction.

*Option B:*

This CoreProp has been discussed extensively over the past days and weeks. If there are questions please refer to the 0VIX discussion sub-channel on the AV DAO discord.

If the community feels it requires even further discussion, then please vote for this option.

The returning of funds will be voted on separately and should appear on Snapshot after review by the community. As it stands now the multi-sig co-signers would be Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi at Polygon Labs and Benjamin.lens, core-contributor at QiDAO.

### Return 0VIX funds to multisig
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #88**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Introduction:*

To achieve a final resolution and ensure a definitive closure to this more than 2 months old issue, we propose advancing with the conclusive vote on sending the funds. These funds will be used to compensate users who have been affected by the 0vix exploit. The longer the process takes, the more uncertainty it brings for them. It is crucial to resolve this so that 0VIX can reopen the markets and distribute the shares to the users in question. For anyone that wants to read up on the topic here are the preceding CoreProps:

* [0vix exploit : Return the funds](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x91189c9e91aca85013b212166163098fa72dbc9e1b9f4260fc08f4075560e3c8)

*Objectives:*

We all have a strong desire to move forward and put this situation behind us, and we want to take a moment to thank you for your help in bringing us to this point.

### Forge 2.0 New Schematics, Methodology, and Godlike Sets
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #89**

**Proposal Summary:**

Takeaway Points:

* We propose 14 new schematics designed by the Forge Team

* MikeyJay’s methodology was used for trait/set selection and should guide any future releases

* We propose 4 new four-piece godlike sets to give all 16 gotchi types access to such a set

* New godlikes maximally incorporate “old/classic” wearables

*New Schematics*

The Forge Team has been working diligently on standardizing and improving the process of new content releases. Intermittent wearable releases have been a staple of engagement for our community and comprise the majority of protocol engagement thus far. New content release comes with extensive backend work, however, especially as the Pixelcraft team transitions all assets to 3D in light of the rebranding and Gotchi Guardians. To this end, it’s imperative that trait and set selection be deliberate and equitable to all gotchi types. This will maximize the available wearables per gotchi, satisfy unmet demand, balance rarity farming, and provide a more balanced collection of assets on which 3rd party games can be built.

MikeyJay’s methodology is outlined in this intensive 13 page document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9e2FEh5NnYXrPEK28UF7GWpsI1ybOsCY94x1kGCpJs/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9e2FEh5NnYXrPEK28UF7GWpsI1ybOsCY94x1kGCpJs/edit)

Specific trait selections by rarity tier and slot are outlined in this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8geMG-uI7yZMn3khWnTzwOLD7_r6kRQawU9kqeMGGg/edit#gid=562462486](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8geMG-uI7yZMn3khWnTzwOLD7_r6kRQawU9kqeMGGg/edit#gid=562462486)

*Sets and Godlike Sets*

A major critique of the Forge 1.0 wearable release was the introduction of a 4-piece godlike set and general “power creep” with new content releases. This was the second 4-piece godlike set and only allowed 3 out of 16 gotchi types access to a 4-piece godlike set. A major goal of this release was to provide all gotchi types access to “end game” with a 4-piece godlike set. Another major goal was to incorporate classic wearables and reduce power creep of newly released wearables as much as possible. To meet this goal, we propose the introduction of 4 new four-piece godlike sets composed of new and classic wearables.

Attached here is the spreadsheet that outlines the number of sets accessible to each of the 16 gotchi types: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VigrwRsUfTSl5sKMYD_Sy7dBDhpNCSu91hTK4mVA-VU/edit#gid=1816507981](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VigrwRsUfTSl5sKMYD_Sy7dBDhpNCSu91hTK4mVA-VU/edit#gid=1816507981)

This release maximally fills gaps in the wearable market and provides all gotchi types access to a four-piece godlike set. It also provides a transparent path forward for new content which can be used by all parties building on the protocol. We are very excited about the art and can’t wait to share more with the community if this and the corresponding distribution proposal are accepted.

### Geodes, Schematic Distribution, and a Final non-drop ticket Raffle
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #90**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Takeaway points:*

* The table below outlines the programmed odds for the multi-tier rarity geode

* The 14 Forge 2.0 Schematics will be distributed 60% through geodes and 40% by raffle

* This raffle will be the last non-drop ticket raffle paving the way for a transition to GLTR tickets

*Geodes:*

Geodes are currently only obtained by smelting wearables which means you can only get new content by smelting old content and burning alloy in the process. This allows for predictable distribution of new content over time. A well-stocked prize pool will transparently drip new content to the community and could be refilled at any time – refills could be new schematics or other prizes, content, partnership items (Anata NFTs), etc. MikeyJay designed the table below outlining odds for Multitier-Rarity Geodes. We plan to push this live in August alongside the Forge 2.0 New Schematic Release. Schematics can be minted and stored in the forge contract until the updated Geode contract is ready.

See Appendix A for details regarding geode odds and prize distribution: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFjdeOae-Pg8r2DHIGvJu7RGennHzZDtZ0lv8v142S8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFjdeOae-Pg8r2DHIGvJu7RGennHzZDtZ0lv8v142S8/edit)

*Forge 2.0 Schematic Distribution:*

We propose that the 14 new wearable schematics be distributed 60% by multi-tier rarity geodes and 40% by traditional raffle using FRENS-purchased tickets. This recommendation comes after soliciting feedback from the community and Pixelcraft. It avoids a resource-intensive auction which comes with a risk of poor user experience. It uses up all remaining FRENS (unless users elect to wait for a drop ticket raffle) and sets an expectation for no further FRENS-based tiered raffles. It also allows for the fun, community-building event of a raffle and slow, drip distribution metered by protocol engagement through the Geode mechanic. Overall, we think the 60:40 distribution strategy threads the needle and respects all stakeholders.

*Final FRENS Tiered-Rarity Raffle*

The Forge Team proposes this raffle be the last traditionally tiered FRENS raffle. This means that Common-Godlike tickets purchased by FRENS will not be used again. They could be converted to Drop Tickets for a final Drop Ticket raffle to be determined later by Pixelcraft or the DAO. This is a significant step toward removing FRENS as a liability on the DAO balance sheet. It paves the way for creation of a GLTR-based raffle system to be used in the future if deemed necessary by PC or the DAO.

Please see the complementary proposal on the Forge 2.0 Schematics release for details on the proposed schematics and methodology.

### Gotchi Crawler Demo Proposal
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #91**

**Proposal Summary:**

Hello frens,

It is with great pleasure to bring forward to you today a proposal for the long-anticipated Gotchi Crawler! Slick and I have teamed up to bring to the community a demo for the game.

*What is Gotchi Crawler?*

Gotchi Crawler is a single or multiplayer (up to three) roguelike dungeon crawler. Players must descend, gather treasure and fight off swarms of enemies along the way. On each floor multiple of ten there is a merchant floor where players may exit the mines, capturing their score. Or, they can choose to descend further. Take note, if they die or run out of time before exiting, their score will be zero! Simply put, the core gameplay loop is enter mines, descend, gather treasure, exit / die, skill up, descend further, repeat The game is designed in such a way to facilitate solo play, however you are at great advantage to play as a team!

*A Boon for Asset Holders*

One of the core design principles is how to bring value back to the community? While creating a fun game is priority #1, we also want to build mechanisms that give fresh new utility to existing Aavegotchi assets. One thing we are really keen on is finding value for as many protocol assets as possible. These concepts are slated for the alpha release and beyond.

*The Road Ahead*

The game will launch in a series of stages: demo, alpha, beta, and the final game. The purpose of the demo is to establish the core gameplay loop. From the demo phase, we will have a better understanding of the scope for the full game and what it will require from the perspective of funding and additional team. We are confident in our abilities to deliver the demo as outlined below:

Target launch: Mid October, 2023

1). Multiplayer:

* 1-3 players

* Client side prediction for lag-free games

2). Levels:

* Three types -battle, adventure, and puzzle

* Randomly spawn destructible objects

* Single biome, the underground forest

3). Destructible objects - these can contain:

* GLTR points (this is how high scores are tracked in the MVP),

* Ladders which allow the team to progress to lower level,

* Lil Essence which if captured adds essence to the essence timer

4). Battle:

* Health/AP bars for gotchis

* In-game stats based on gotchi traits

* Geode smasher & fireball weapons

* Dash mechanic for gotchis

* Enemies with health bars only (no mage creeps yet!)

* Simple enemy AI (roaming with an aggro range trigger)

5). Puzzles

* Team-dependent pressure switches implemented into the levels

* Special doors that can only be opened with switches that (usually) contain treasure

6). Essence timer:

* Shared timer for all team mates

* Approximately 15 minutes of play

* Capture “Lil Essence” to increase play time

7). Scoring:

* GLTR = points

* One score per gotchi

8). Merchant / exit floor:

* every multiple of 10, players will be able to escape and capture their score or descend lower

9). Gameover screen:

* Appears for a gotchi if their HP goes to zero

* Appears for entire team if Essence goes to zero

10). Sound FX & background song

11). Leaderboard:

* Per gotchi

* XP event (TBC and pending Pixelcraft approval)

We believe this will give enough of a gameplay experience for the community to enjoy, provide feedback for, and determine whether they wish for the game development to continue.

### Aaveghostly Latina Spin Dream
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #92**

**Proposal Summary:**

I have put myself a challenge to cycle all around the whole Iberian Penisula region using only the strength of my own muscles, my goal is to draw a big circle on a map and finish where I started.

To spice that adventure up I will sleep in the wilderness in my tent or hammock.

Whole journey is going to be recorded using GoPro 11 with full attachments and additionally with Xiaomi MI 10T.

Video content will be recorded in English and Polish language, all content is going to be daily posted/streamed on my non-web3 journey-related Polish social media which is Facebook and Instagram, and English web3 crypto-related Twitter profile. After returning home from cycling, all gathered materials will be used to create YouTube videos which will be in both languages for both audiences.

There will be hundreds of gigabytes of videos, and around 44 days of cycling should be edited into around 6-15 full YouTube episodes, they are going to be partially launched on YouTube, even a long time afterwise the journey, I will add all of them and fulfill what was started regarding the time passed.

I believe that the Aavegotchi Ghost theme, will show people even more how important are their lives and show them how important are good helpful people/communities around them.

To promote Aavegotchi worldwide thanks to my double-languaged viral video content and to bring masses not only from outside the Aavegotchi ecosystem but also outside the whole web3 scene.

My proposal is to create an official Sponsorship/Partnership deal so whole journey will be signed under the official Aavegotchi wing.

In return for the sponsorship, I commit to promoting the Aavegotchi brand and community in various ways.

This includes:

* Incorporating Aavegotchi content into our adventure videos. (Putting logos, fonts, Aavegotchis and with every other possible way)

* Wearing Aavegotchi-branded merchandise during our journey. (T-shirts, Flags, stickers on my equipment and whatever other is possible)

* Creating dedicated promotional videos for Aavegotchi. (Videos in which I talk strictly bout Aavegotchi and explain the project + simple mentions)

* Creating dedicated promotional threads for Aavegotchi. (+ tagging in my content tweets etc.)

* Displaying the Aavegotchi logo on all our official adventure videos. (Exactly the created YouTube episodes and adding everywhere information about the official partnership)

* Leaving Aavegotchi-branded stickers throughout Spain and Portugal. (Randomly sticking to places where it is possible, or giving away to people explaining what it is)

To make that deal happen and realize my vision with that Partnership deal I would like to get paid only expenses which I will spend on food through whole cycling and transport of me + bicycle back and forth by plane.

### Alchemica Spending Competition - Season 3
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #93**

**Proposal Summary:**

Season 3 parameters:

2 one–week rounds (Most of the activity came within first two weeks of competition, and so this should be the focus)

* Week one: 28 August (Monday) to 3 September (Sunday)

* Week two: 4 September (Monday) to 10 September (Sunday)

30k GSHT reward for each round funded from gotchiverse player rewards wallet

Multiplier for both weeks will be the same: 1.8x – 1.6 – 1.4x – 1.3x – 1.2x – 1.1x – 1x

(We believe this give incentive to build early, moving focus from the “last minute” spenders as they would have bigger cost to move up in the leaderboard)

Top 100 places paid each round

(We want to experiment with longer tail. The kinship burn mechanic had a major impact on the alchemica emission. We saw about 300% reduction in alchemica emissions from channeling, and therefore we think this season could attract some new builders inside gotchiverse)

TOTAL WINNER of competiton will get a unique “Statue” decoration from Pixelcraft once the 3D Gothiverse launches, there will be only 1 statue like this inside the Gotchiverse.

WINNER of each week get a “Trophie” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 2 out of 2 fake (super rare)

FIRST to TENTH place for each week get a “Medal” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 20 out of 20 fake (still quite rare)

SOJUs work is commissioned, and would be sent to SOJUs wallet 0x8CbF96319b3C56d50a7C82EFb6d3c46bD6f889Ba after the FAKES are delivered to the winners. The price of commission is 250 GHST for each fake + 70 GHST floor for 1 FAKE card, so in total 640 GHST payed from Gotchiverse reward pool

Final words: We believe this competition could “flush out” plenty of alchemica from circulation. The effect should be longer term, as the channeling emissions are reduced after kinship burn implementation. At the same time, we would incentive more builders to come to gotchiverse, and potentially turn them into alchemica bulls.

### Revamp the Aavegotchi Rental Protocol to support Parcels and Wearables
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #94**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Why does the DAO need a new Rental Protocol?*

The current Rental Protocol was specifically made for the Aavegotchi use case. It will take a great deal of time to add support for other NFTs, which would have to be implemented one at a time with much customisation.

Moreover, the DAO does not benefit from Rental activity. 100% of the $GHST generated goes straight to the lender, meaning token holders are not rewarded even when the marketplace bursts with usage.

Finally, the DAO needs a standard interface to list new NFTs when they are launched. There are many unexplored use cases for lending Wearables, Tiles, and Installations, and by providing a standard interface, the DAO will have an easy path to list these new assets.

*Proposed Solution*

We propose to create a custom implementation of ERC-7432, including a contract that stores all role assignments for all NFTs of the Aavegotchi ecosystem. This approach will tremendously simplify how utility delegation is implemented since all logic will be centralised in a single contract owned by the DAO.

However, it’s important to highlight that this proposal only covers Aavegotchis, Land Parcels, and Wearables. Other NFTs can still be listed, but we must review their current functionality to ensure they will work as expected.

*Deliverables & Timeline*

Here is a complete list of all the deliverables included in this Proposal:

* Smart Contracts:

    * Aavegotchi Diamond contract update.

    * Land Parcel Diamond contract update.

    * Wearables Diamond contract update.

    * New Contract: Roles Registry (ERC-7432).

* Subgraphs:

    * Roles & Marketplace.

* Front-End & Back-End:

    * UI for Direct Rentals.

    * UI for Marketplace.

    * API to parse Subgraph data.

After assessing the technical effort to implement the items above, the team estimated the development time in four months. All deliverables will be transferred to the DAO control, except for the Front-End & Back-End.

*Cost Breakdown*

The team working on this project contains five full-time developers: three Solidity Engineers and 2 Full-Stack developers. Since we will spend four months developing the project, with an average compensation of 5,000 DAI per developer per month, the team is requesting a budget of 80,000 DAI to deliver this project.

We also suggest a payment schedule of three tranches:

* 20,000 DAI when the proposal is approved.

* 30,000 DAI when the Smart Contracts are delivered.

* 30,000 DAI when the Subgraphs and UI are delivered.

*ROI (Return on Investment)*

The result would depend on the marketplace volume and the royalties established by the DAO. The DAO would still earn a substantial return even in a low-volume year.

### Gotchi Heroes Reworked Version Proposal
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #95**

**Proposal Summary:**

The Gotchi Heroes Reworked version is the culmination of valuable feedback received over the past year, representing our ultimate dream of creating a fun-to-play Aavegotchi Idle game. The key improvements and new features include:

* A full graphical revamp, encompassing game items, objects, battle scenes, and monsters, to enhance the visual experience. (Artwork Included)

* Fully animated battles between Aavegotchis and monsters, allowing you to witness epic fights and see your beloved gotchis in action. (Artwork Included)

* A completely redesigned UI/UX to provide a better and smoother gaming experience. (Artwork Included)

* The introduction of numerous new features, including account progression and leveling up, achievements, dungeon gameplay mode, a new in-game item crafting system, epic boss battles with a loot system, pet companions, and much more!

* Finally, we have worked on balancing the Leaderboard climbing experience by reducing the presence of pay-to-win elements and adding more in-game loot, objectives, and activities mentioned above.

* And yet, this is just the beginning of our journey with this newly improved Aavegotchi Idle game, which will soon be ready to be introduced to the entire blockchain world.

*Proposal*

This proposal outlines our request for Aavegotchi DAO's support in migrating Gotchi Heroes to the Unity game engine and eventually the Gotchichain. This endeavor is not just a cosmetic upgrade; it's a comprehensive revamp of the game, from its core framework to its user interface. We are working with a game developer and game artist so the assets shown are real life examples of how the game will change.

How will Aavegotchi DAO Benefit?

Here's what Aavegotchi DAO stands to gain:

* Improved Player Experience: By enhancing the graphics and incorporating fresh game mechanics, we promise a vastly improved and more immersive player experience.

* Inclusion of Alchemica: The integration of Alchemica is already complete This move will offer new in-game actions and raise their utility.

* Token Burning: We plan to burn 50% of the Alchemica deployed for in-game actions, which will effectively serve as a sink for Aavegotchi tokens.

We project a budget of 50k DAI for this initiative. This figure encompasses the costs of redevelopment, graphic enhancement, testing, implementation, and subsequent maintenance.

### Rarity Farming Season 7
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #96**

**Proposal Summary:**

We are proposing that we start rarity farming season 7 on Halloween, October 31 (if deemed feasible by PC, or ASAP after that in consultation with PC).

We’ve been aiming for ~3 rarity farming seasons a year, and our proposed Halloween start date ends this third 2023 season right around the end of the year. This proposal suggests keeping reward parameters largely the same as the prior several seasons, with the addition of a 100k prize pool for Gotchi Battler. Last season used the following reward parameters:

4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury

* 70% BRS

* 20% Kinship

* 10% XP

Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)

For the upcoming season we want to add a 4th category for Gotchi Battler. The prizepool will be increased to 1.6M total GHST and the extra 100K will be for a Gotchi Battler tournament. The tournament can have up to 4096 teams entered with each team comprising of 5 gotchis, this means a total of 20,480 gotchis could enter, although we'd expect a lot less than that.

The tournament will be a single elimination tournament with 1 round each day. To participate you just need to enter your team during the registration period at the start of the tournament, then your team will automatically progress through each round. Once the VRF has been rolled for the round each day you can view all the battles on the Gotchi Battler website. The tournament will take place before the end of the season and we will have many "test" tournaments with small prize pools beforehand so there will be plenty of opportunity to practice and figure out what your best team configuration is.

Launch period: Season 7 round 1 to commence on October 31, or as soon as deemed feasible by PC

### Aavegotchi DAO Mission Statement
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #98**

**Proposal Summary:**

This is a second submission to achieve approval for the great work done by gud frens in this prop. The first submission received widespread support but unfortunately did not attain quorum before closure. Thanks for getting us this far Fantasma and crew. Let’s get it all the way Home this time, frens. -Mycaleum

*Prop:*

For quite a long time, our DAO has faced the challenge of passing proposals, funding initiatives, making changes to DAO mechanics, all while postponing answering our most basic questions. What are we? Who are we? What do we stand for? What is the reason and purpose of our DAOs existence?

It has not been a straight or obvious path, but the journey of discovery for the many frens here, has been deeply enjoyable and illuminating. We humbly present you with a mission statement we believe most successfully aims at the core and soul of the purpose and spirit of our DAO. We hope you find enthusiastic agreement, as we did.

Without further ado, we propose that the mission statement of Aavegotchi Dao be ratified as:

“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”

*The Word-Salad Graveyard (terms that were deliberately excluded):*

Gotchigang:

Many felt this endearment could instead create an exclusionary feeling to potential or prospective readers considering joining our DAO.

Web3/SDK/Protocol/Blockchain/L2/decentralization/metaverse:

All of these words were sprinkled among the earlier (and lengthier) versions of our mission statement. We drew inspiration from the most successful organizations in history, and chose to avoid directly mentioning the product, the technology or explicitly what we do. Nintendo’s mission statement doesn’t even mention gaming consoles.

members/participants:

This was one of the toughest choices. These identifiers were ultimately supplanted by “player”, to avoid being exclusionary or stale and uninspiring.

gamers, game, play:

Just how much to convey our gaming focus and roots was a point of constant consideration. We feel that by addressing “players”, this spirit is sufficiently covered. “Player” is also a synonym for “participant”. As such, participants that engage with the DAO and protocol can always be considered players, even if they are not gamers.

*Why bother with a mission statement?*

What does the DAO achieve from this vote and effort?

By answering our most basic organizational identity questions, a ratified Mission Statement gives our DAO cohesive intention. It also paves the way towards creation of a funded working group to formulate our Vision Statement. Ultimately, this skill tree leads to high quality operational achievements such as organizational charts and workstreams, budget proposals that align with the intention of the DAO, diverse and effective contributors and more. Our Mission Statement will be a philosophical rally point for the entire community, and provide a stronghold to empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.

### Gotchi Greetoors (formerly ITF) Funding
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #99**

**Proposal Summary:**

As we are on the precipice of multiple releases of new games and a refreshed Gotchiverse, I believe it is time for the DAO to take our IRL presence to the next level! Pixelcraft has stepped up big time, putting in some aavesome efforts with the BFG and new booth design. Now it’s time for us to take that and show the world what Gotchigaang is all about! I am proposing the creation of the Gotchi Greetoors (formerly ITF), which would be responsible for the following:

* Coordinate IRL strategy in collaboration with Pixelcraft

* Handling administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO (Business Development, Partnerships, onboarding of talent, administrative duties, general networking)

* Source a minimum of 25% of event/booth staff from local dao members where/when applicable

* Manage event booth + staff in tandem with Lost Local or other PC employees

* Find lodging to house DAO staff members for the duration of the event at a budget-friendly price

* DAO-related content capture, post production of content, and ensuring timely delivery of said DAO content to social streams and proof-of-attendance via live streaming

* Explore feasibility of creating DAO revenue streams via DAO-sourced merch, ticketed events, IRL tournaments, etc

* Developing DAO-to-DAO and DAO-to-influencer collaborations for events and content capture

* Coordinate DAO representation at events outside of PC’s scope that are beneficial to the DAO

* Curate and source lRL wearables for gotchigang attending each event

* Quarterly reporting on task force activity

* Budgets for previous & following quarter

* Report on events attended (bizdev + partnership leads, activations, etc.)

* Strategy for upcoming quarter’s events

* Planning Phase 2 for implementation after event strategy has been perfected

* community led meetups + tournaments in gotchi IRL hot zones, GotchiCon, more TBD

This team would consist of:

* Litepiglet - Admin Lead

* Nofuturistic - Media Lead

* Lost Local - Pixelcraft Liaison

* Tburd - Lead Support or aka assistant to the assistant regional manager

We are requesting a total budget of $80,000 paid as $20,000 per quarter, in USDC or DAI, which would be converted to USDC upon transfer. This task force would need to submit for funding for any additional time period after the first year. This funding would rollover to the following quarter if it is not spent in the previous one and any excess would be returned to the DAO after the 1 year funding period is up. These funds will be used for DAO member payments for the following:

* Travel

* Per diem

* Event/booth work

* Incidental travel expenses (lost luggage, flight delays, etc)

Also included would be quarterly compensation to the task force in the following amounts:

* Nofuturistic - 750 USDC

* Litepiglet - 500 USDC

* Tburd - 350 USDC

Option 1: Yes fund

Option 2: No do not fund

### Mechagotchis V1
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #100**

**Proposal Summary:**

Set in a remote training ground somewhere in the Gotchiverse, players will be able to engage in intense PvP battles. For game mode 1 we'll be focused on multiplayer and damage system development, followed by Gotchi trait integration and mech customization.

*Game Mechanics*

Players will pilot their Mechagotchis using a mouse and keyboard , with future updates to include controller support.

The game's mechanics are deeply tied to the Gotchi traits, which tentatively influence mech performance as follows:

* Energy: Balances Health Points and Action Points.

* Aggression: Dictates the strength of Shields and Attack Speed.

* Spookyness: Affects the chance for Dodge and Critical Hits.

* Brain Size: Determines the power of Melee versus Ranged attacks.

* Eyes shape and Color effect TBC

*Blockchain Integration*

Blockchain technology is at the heart of Mechagotchis, enabling the distribution of reward tokens and NFTs that represent rare mech upgrades and to verify ownership for exclusive in-game content (eg. LE Gold Skin for Mechagotchi FAKEgotchi holders.)

*Community Engagement*

The game will foster community involvement through active dev logs, Beta test parties, a community mech design contest, and potentially even a level-builder for user-generated maps. And of course at the end of each phase’s development we will hold our usual XP event/ playtest. These initiatives should contribute to the game's evolution as well as engage players and help them feel more involved in the development process.

*Platform*

Mechagotchis is a web-based PC game developed in Unity, ensuring broad accessibility while maintaining high-quality graphics and gameplay.

*Customization*

Mech customization will evolve from simple paint jobs to extensive modifications, including weapons, armor, and other mech parts, allowing players to tailor their combatants to their playstyle, modifying their in-game behavior. Think of this part like “wearables for your mech”

*Timeline*

This proposal is to fund development of game mode 1, which is expected to enter beta testing within two months. Milestones will include devlogs, environment designs, secondary mech design finalization, closed group beta testing, wider testing, and an XP event tournament!

*Expected Costs*

Total Cost: 20K USD

Breakdown:

* 4K - Project Management

* 5K - 3D modeling/Animation/Rigging

* 4K - Front-end Development

* 6K - Back-end Development

* 1K - Server Deployment + maintenance

### Strategotchi V1: Funding Proposal
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #101**

**Proposal Summary:**

The original version of Strategotchi was proposed as a strategy game that featured lengthy multiplayer games. Following community feedback, significant refinements were made to the game concept, mechanics, and graphics.

*Strategotchi Tactics Litepaper:*

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dtKyTLHUWB35UxmfNXlXl9TK6mRCsbHkuxkiJht6Q4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dtKyTLHUWB35UxmfNXlXl9TK6mRCsbHkuxkiJht6Q4)

Since the initial vote, the game's development has been ongoing, with the focus shifting towards a single-player experience, blending elements of a tactical RPG, rogue-lite and a puzzle game. The current iteration presents an innovative blend, requiring players to skillfully manage various elements of a mining operation.

*Gameplay:*

The game is essentially a puzzler disguised as a tactical RPG. Individual levels are puzzle-like, with moveable pieces and a finite number of rounds to achieve your goals, yet there is a heavy emphasis on battle strategy. You train and build your Gotchis (predefined avatars and actual Gotchis) the way you want, utilizing various classes with unique advantages.

The weapons and Gotchis you choose define your play style. Each protocol weapon has a unique effect that “moves things” around in different ways. Typical attacks cause damage as well as push units back. Lassos pull things. Grenades disperse crowds. Other weapons might temporarily freeze or teleport units to another location. With the multitude of available weapons in the Aavegotchi protocol, players will be able to tailor unique teams to suit their play style and gain experience to upgrade and grow their characters and equipment as they see fit.

*Level Progression:*

The game incorporates rogue-like elements (resembling a dungeon run) where you try to get as far as you can through a series of procedurally generated landscapes. Players aim to harvest as much REDACTED as they can to stop their Reputation (REP) from inevitably reaching zero. Luckily you can use earnings to buy your REP back from shady characters you meet in the wild. Earnings can also be used to upgrade weapons and equipment, enhancing the player's chances of advancing further.

*V1 Overview:*

V1’s objective is to highlight the core gameplay mechanics, offering a glimpse into the possibilities of Strategotchi. It will showcase a singular game mode featuring an “infinite island” (dungeon) with a predefined party of avatars. Your aim is to progress as far as possible through the island and maintain your REP, clearing procedurally generated levels with unique parameters. Once you lose your REP, your run is over and your final score is tallied.

*Current Development Status:*

The project has achieved significant milestones, including fully modeled assets, procedural level generation, functional player and enemy systems, enemy AI and targeting mechanisms. The front end has been completely revamped from the initial prototype and the GUI has been redesigned and partially implemented

*Remaining Tasks:*

* Revamp player movement system

* Revamp player interaction system

* Create inter collision damage system

* Complete GUI implementation

* Sound design

* Leaderboards

* Juice/eye candy/VFX

*Funding Request*

Seeking a $12,000 grant in USD equivalent (USDC or DAI) to expedite Unity development and accelerate the completion of V1. The funding will support finalization of the remaining tasks and shipping of a playable game within a 4-6 week timeframe.

### Strategic Treasury Diversification into Ethereum with $3M ETH Purchase
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #103**

**Proposal Summary:**

The proposal recommends the Aavegotchi DAO to diversify its treasury by purchasing 3,000,000 DAI worth of ETH. This acquisition would be executed through Cowswap on the Ethereum blockchain, divided into six weekly tranches of 500,000 DAI each. Funds will come from the DAO Foundation Treasury Wallet which stems from the 25% treasury allocation after curve closure.

*Current Treasury Composition:*

* GHST: 16,223,059 ($16,098,141 @ $0.9923)

* DAI: 8,886,873

* USDC: 3,756,276

Total Value: $28,741,290

*Post-Purchase Treasury Composition:*

* GHST: $16,098,141 (56%)

* USDC: $3,756,276 (13%)

* DAI: $5,886,873 (21%)

* ETH: $3,000,000 (10%)

*Benefits:*

* Enhanced Portfolio Diversification: Acquiring ETH introduces a high-potential asset, reducing overreliance on stablecoins and GHST.

* Reduced DAI Exposure: Decreases dependency on a single stablecoin, mitigating specific stablecoin risks.

* Hedging Against Inflation: ETH, as a non-fiat asset, offers a hedge against USD inflationary pressures.

* Capital Appreciation Potential: ETH has historically shown significant growth potential, offering possible higher returns compared to stablecoins.

* Access to DeFi Opportunities: ETH holdings can be leveraged for staking or other DeFi instruments, potentially generating additional revenue.

* Simple Execution: The proposed method of acquisition is straightforward and can be executed with relative ease.

*Additional Benefits:*

* Liquidity and Market Depth: ETH, being a major cryptocurrency, offers high liquidity and market depth, facilitating easy entry and exit.

* Community Engagement: Participation in a major blockchain like Ethereum could enhance community engagement and visibility.

*Potential Risks and Challenges:*

* Market Volatility: ETH is subject to high price volatility, which could significantly impact the value of the DAO's treasury.

* Accessibility of Funds: Allocating a portion of funds in ETH may complicate treasury access, as proposals would need to clearly specify fund origination requiring additional transactions by the Directors.

*Execution:*

The purchase will come from the DAO Director Multisig Safe (0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62) using funds from the DAO Foundation Treasury Wallet (0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c). The purchases will be made in 6 equal, weekly tranches of 500,000 DAI using Cowswap.

*Conclusion:*

This proposal strategically diversifies the Aavegotchi DAO’s treasury by leveraging the potential of Ethereum while being mindful of the associated risks. If this proposal is accepted by the Aavegotchi DAO, a separate, second proposal will be produced to consider staking acquired ETH on Lido.

### Upgrading the ATF
**Aavegotchi Improvement Proposal #104**

**Proposal Summary:**

*Background*

The ATF was officially formed in [AGIP54](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x123768584b0e878a6466a293e402702de7427f0657ea24fd60d71589d0b3003e). In amost a year, there has only been one request to the ATF for prize pool funding and 99,500 GHST remains along with 70+ Fake Cards in the ATF treasury wallet:

* 0x921D8FDF089775D5AC61b2d6e8f34F1edd554D8f

*Problem*

The ATF treasury is under-utilized. Uptake on prize pool funds has been minimal due to lack of new minigames. There have also been instances where more substantial Aavegotchi games have requested funds but due to the ATF’s hard limit of 500 GHST per game, they have instead had to complete a full SigProp/CoreProp application to the DAO. E.g. [AGIP 97](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5fa86c431e3e0d5429906f86d1182781b7f0366f554a57631cf0c8fd2dd1c2b5).

*Solution*

The ATF would like to propose the following updates to their operation of treasury funds so that individual game developers can apply for, and be granted up to:

* 4000 GHST per calendar year to fund their gaming prize pools

* 5 fake gotchi cards per calendar year to be used as part of their game competitions

* 1000 GHST per calendar year to assist with server hosting costs, playtest funding, fake gotchi artist commissions, marketing and any other activities that help raise awareness for, or assist development of, their game.

*End Goal & Benefits*

This proposal will:

* Allow game developers more flexibility when creating prize pools

* Create quicker turnaround for funding approvals

* Encourage use of predominantly dormant ATF prize pool funds that are available for the community

*Updated ATF Members*

As per original ATF creation proposal, 4 out of 7 signers will be required for all transactions and approval of funding requests. Some of our original signers have now moved on and the updated list of 7 signers will be:

* Slick

* PG

* Scrooger

* Hefe

* Mycaleum

* Laggin

* Chair

Please note, if one of the ATF signers is requesting funding, they will not be able to sign for that specific transaction should the ATF agree to provide funding.

*Conclusion*

Thank you for your time Gotchigang, now let's vote!

Option 1: Yes, upgrade!

Option 2: No, don't upgrade

### Eligibility of GHST-USDC LP tokens to earn FRENS

**Snapshot Voting**

**Proposal Summary:** Should GHST-USDC LP token be eligible to earn FRENS?

Our liquidity migration program has been a huge success, with over 8M GHST migrated to Polygon already. However, as many community members have noted, liquidity for the GHST-USDC pair is still not deep enough to support trading large amounts of USDC for GHST on Quickswap.

We believe one way to remedy this is by adding GHST-USDC as a pair eligible for FRENS on [https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon). Just like GHST-QUICK has a receipt token stkGHST-QUICK, staked GHST-USDC can also emit a stkGHST-USDC token, which may be eligible for rewards on Quickswap, if their team deems it necessary.

Since this decision directly affects gameplay, we believe it is a ripe candidate for our first Snapshot vote on Polygon.

We are setting a 500,000 GHST quorum for this vote to be enacted.

The GHST-USDC LP token will earn FRENS at the same rate as just staking GHST, since impermanent loss is minimal and fees are significant.

### Portals purchased in one transaction

**Snapshot Voting**

**Proposal Summary:** How many Portals can be purchased in one transaction?

Discussion period has ended for this topic, and now it's time to vote! The most popular options were: 1, 5, and 10 Portals per transaction.

Our fren [@coderdannn](/team#coder-dan) also threw a spicy idea into the mix: an "Ape Tax" whereby higher numbers of Portals could be bought in a single transaction, but at a higher price. The Portals would be tiered as so:

* 0-5: 100 GHST each

* 6-15: 200 GHST each

* 16-25: 300 GHST each

So this leaves us with four options: 1, 5, 10, and 25 (w/ ape tax).

Let your $GHST token speak for you, and vote!

Voting period: 72 hrs Minimum quorum: 10% of GHST on Matic (~1.1M GHST)
