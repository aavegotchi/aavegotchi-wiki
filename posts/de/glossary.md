Wenn du gerade erst angefangen hast, die Welt von DeFi zu erkunden, dann willkommen in dieser Ecke des Internets! Dieses Glossar soll dir einige Informationen zur Verfügung stellen, die dir hoffentlich helfen, die DeFi Grundlagen zu verstehen. Wenn du ganz neu in diesem Bereich bist, wird dir dieses Glossar auch einen Überblick über einige Begriffe geben, die du erwarten kannst, wenn du durch die Aavegotchi-Welt wanderst, um dein Verständnis weiter zu verbessern.


Wenn du mit dem Lesen fertig bist und hoffentlich ein besseres Verständnis für diese Begriffe hast, kannst du gerne in den ONBOARDING Bereich springen und in das eigentliche Ökosystem eintauchen.

## Aavegotchi-verwandt

### Aavegotchi
Aavegotchis sind pixelförmige Geister, die auf der Ethereum Blockchain leben und durch den ERC-721 Standard unterstützt werden. Ihr Wert wird durch die [Seltenheitsstufe](/rarity-farming) bestimmt, die über mehrere Faktoren berechnet wird, wie z.B. Basis-Eigenschaften, Menge an [hinterlegten Sicherheiten](atokens) und ausgerüstete [Kleidungsstücke](/wearables).

### FRENS
Punkte, die an Benutzer vergeben werden, die GHST staken. FRENS ist kein Token. Technisch gesehen handelt es sich um ein Guthaben innerhalb des Staking Contracts. FRENS sind nicht übertragbar und dienen dazu, Staker für ihren Beitrag zum Aavegotchi-Projekt zu belohnen.

### Spirit Force
Spirit Force bezieht sich auf die Menge an Sicherheiten (aTokens), die im Gotchi eingeschlossen sind.

### Spirit Point
Spirit Point bezieht sich auf einen Punkt, den ein Gotchi erhält, wenn es auflevelt. Ähnlich wie Stats-Punkte in RPG-Spielen. Du erhältst 1 Spirit Point alle 3 Level.

### Kleidungsstücke
Kleidung/Ausrüstung, die dein Aavegotchi trägt. Sie entsprechen dem ERC-1155 Standard.

## DeFi 101

"DeFi" steht für **De**centralized **Fi**nance. It can be thought of as an ecosystem of applications and protocols that provide similar services to traditional financial institutions (ie, lending, borrowing, and accruing interests from saving, amongst others). However, there is one key difference - DeFi aims to do this in a decentralized manner with no middle man.


That means no banks taking a cut of your potential returns or providing you with negative interest rates. That also means no central point of failure where the entire system could collapse, or be subjected to a set of rules decided and implemented by a small group with concentrated power.


At the time of writing (December 5 2020), the Total Value Locked in Defi stands at 14.24B USD.

## Key Terms

### APY
APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. This is the real rate of return earned on the savings you have deposited into a protocol, taking into account the effect of compounding your interest.



### Sicherheiten/Collateral
Collateral is a pretty straightforward concept. It refers to an asset you might put down as a form of guarantee to a lender, when borrowing money from them. If you cannot pay back your loan, your collateral will be used to pay your debt.


In the context of DeFi, this is how things might look:


Let's say you want to borrow some assets from a protocol. For this to happen, you will need to set down a portion of your other assets as collateral. If you don't pay your loan back, the protocol will not release your collateral back to you.

In the Aavegotchi metaverse, collaterals are also known as [Spirit Force](/glossary#spirit-force).

### DAICO
Stands for Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offering. It is a new fundraising method that seeks to incorporate the best features of a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](/glossary#dao) with those of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to create a structure that provides a higher level of effectiveness to the token sale fundraising model. Ein DAICO ist ein Modell, bei dem die Investoren die Kontrolle über die gesammelten Gelder haben, sobald das Fundraising vorbei ist. Die Investoren können durch einen "Tap" Mechanismus Einfluss darauf nehmen, wie die Entwickler Zugang zu den Geldern haben und mit welcher Regelmässigkeit. Ausserdem können die Investoren auch für den Ausstieg aus dem Projekt stimmen und ihre Gelder zurückbekommen.

### DAO
Otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. These are organizations that are organizations governed by rules as encoded by smart contracts and controlled by its members. This is as opposed to traditional organizational models, which often tend to be governed by a small group of authority figures.

In the context of the AavegotchiDAO, what this means is that members of the ecosystem will be able to initiate and vote on proposals that will influence how the larger ecosystem will run. For instance, members might propose to increase the number of Portals available over time, amongst any other feature that they feel would help improve the community.

For more a more detailed explainer on DAOs, check out [this page](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/) .



### DEX
Otherwise known as a Decentralized Exchange. Such platforms allow users to handle transactions in a peer-to-peer manner, to obtain tokens through a user's own wallet with the help of smart contracts. This is as opposed to the way CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) work, which operate through a middleman (the CEX itself).


Some examples of DEXs include UniSwap, Mesa and Balancer.


Some examples of CEXs include Binance, Coinbase and OKex.


### Flash Loans
Remember what we mentioned above about loans and collaterals? Well, flash loans are a form of loan that get around that need for putting down collateral. However, there's a catch.

The flash loan has to be repaid within the same transaction block.

If this doesn't happen, the whole transaction is reversed to effectively undo the actions executed up until that point. You can read more about Flash Loans [here](https://aave.com/flash-loans/).



### Impermanent Loss
Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a pool (see [Liquidity Pools](/glossary#liquidity-pools)), and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. This would result in a loss if, at the point in time you wish to withdraw your assets, the price has decreased from when you first deposited them. This leads to a lower dollar value at the time of your withdrawal.



### Liquiditätspools
The term is somewhat self-explanatory. These are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. They are in turn used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.


For a more detailed breakdown of these terms, check out Finematics's [guide](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/).



### Oracles
In order for Smart Contracts to execute, certain conditions need to be met. Information about the presence of these conditions needs to be fed to the blockchain that the contract is on. This is because blockchains typically do not have ready access to information outside of the chain. This is where oracles come into the picture. These entities provide the necessary data to trigger smart contracts.



### Smart Contracts
Generally speaking, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the "terms of agreement" between the users of the contract being directly written into the code of the contract itself. When these predetermined terms and certain conditions are met, the contract executes.



### Staking
Staking a cryptocurrency essentially means to hold that currency, to help verify transactions and support the network. In exchange for doing so, stakers typically receive some kind of reward. In the Aavegotchi world for instance, $GHST stakers are rewarded with FRENS (points) that they can use to buy tickets and win prizes in periodic raffles.



### Yield Farming
Very simply put, yield farming is a practice that allows users to earn rewards by depositing and lending their assets in a particular protocol.

This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most common mechanism is when depositers/borrowers earn coins from a protocol, by simply staking their ERC-20 tokens and/or stable coins on its platform. Usually, these rewards are used to incentivize potential depositers and borrowers to add liquidity to a particular platform.


## Allgemeine Begriffe

### Aragon
Aragon is an open-source, community-driven project with the mission to empower freedom by creating tools for decentralized organizations to thrive.

The flagship product of the project is the Aragon client, a tool for creating and participating in decentralized organizations on Ethereum. The project is also building the Aragon Network, the world's first digital jurisdiction.

The Aragon project is stewarded by the Aragon Association, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and governed by Aragon Network Token holders.

Check out their [site](https://aragon.org/) here.

### Glockenkurve
A bell curve is a common type of distribution for a variable, also known as the normal distribution. The term "bell curve" originates from the fact that the graph used to depict a normal distribution consists of a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. See this [page](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bell-curve.asp) for more information.

### ERC-20
A token standard for fungible token, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token. It provides functionalities such as transferring tokens from one account to another, getting the current token balance of an account and also the total supply of the token available on the network. Besides these, it also has some other functionalities such as approving an amount of tokens that can be spent by a third party account. See [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) for more information.

### ERC-721
A free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.

Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.

For a full explanation of what the ERC-721 standard entails, check it out [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

### ERC-998
ERC-998 is an extension to the [ERC-721](/glossary#erc-721) standard that adds the ability for [non-fungible tokens](/glossary#nft) to own other non-fungible tokens and ERC-20 tokens.

Non-fungible tokens that implement ERC998 also implement the ERC-721 standard.

For a full explanation of what the ERC-998 standard entails, check it out [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-998).

### Matic Netzwerk
Matic Network is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation, Matic supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

Read more about Matic Network [here](https://matic.network/).

### Metaverse

A metaverse is a virtual world where you can interact with aspects of the world itself (like games or shops) as well as with other users.

Some examples of metaverses include the <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse">Aavegotchi Realm</a> in addition to projects like Second Life and Decentraland.


### Non-Fungible Token

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something **unique**, meaning it cannot be swapped out for any other token. Non-fungible tokens typically represent ownership of items such as wearables, works of art, or any other type of property.

The **opposite** of a non-fungible token is one that can be exchanged for any other of its kind, like USDC or Bitcoin. Tokens that can be swapped 1:1 for a coin of the same kind are known as fungible tokens.
