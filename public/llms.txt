# Aavegotchi Wiki (wiki.aavegotchi.com)

Aavegotchi is a web3 gaming universe where players collect, customize, and play with ghost NFTs called Aavegotchis. Aavegotchis have onchain traits, equip wearable NFTs, and participate in gameplay systems such as rarity farming and Gotchiverse. This wiki is the long-form documentation hub for the game, ecosystem, and protocol history.

## Key change: Migration to Base (2025-07-25)

On 2025-07-25, Aavegotchi's canonical home migrated from Polygon to Base. Polygon-era contracts are frozen/view-only for most actions; Polygon-era pages are primarily historical context.
