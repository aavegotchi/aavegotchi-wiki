# Aavegotchi Wiki

> The official knowledge base for Aavegotchi — a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game on Base (L2). Aavegotchis are yield-generating NFT avatars backed by Aave aTokens, governed by the GHST token and AavegotchiDAO. Developed by Pixelcraft Studios.

Aavegotchi migrated from Polygon to Base in July 2025. Polygon contracts are frozen/view-only. All current gameplay, transactions, and governance happen on Base.

## Tokens

- **GHST**: Eco-governance token. Fixed supply ~52.7M. Used for marketplace transactions, DAO voting (1 token = 1 vote), and rarity farming rewards. Live on Ethereum, Base. Contract (Base): 0xcd2f22236dd9dfe2356d7c543161d4d260fd9bcb
- **Gotchus Alchemica** (FUD, FOMO, ALPHA, KEK): Four in-game resource tokens used in the Gotchiverse for crafting installations and tiles on REALM parcels.
- **GLTR** (GAX Liquidity Token Reward): Earned by staking LP tokens; used to speed up crafting in the Gotchiverse.
